# Descartes's Background

[René Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/) (1596-1650) was
born in La Haye in [the Touraine region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touraine)
of France. His father, Joachim, was part of the landed gentry and a
parlamentarian in [Brittany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany). Descartes's
mother, Jeanne Brochard, died when he was barely a year old. He was raised
primarily by his maternal grandmother. He had at least two older siblings, a
sister (Jeanne) and a brother (Pierre).

In 1606 or 1607, Descartes entered the newly founded
[Jesuit College](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit) of La Fleche, where he
remained until 1614 or 1615. He recieved an education typical of this school,
with five to six years of 'grammar' school studying classical Latin, Greek, and
the major poets and orators (e.g. Cicero). This was followed by three years of
philosophical training, which was slightly less typical, since many students
would, after five years, go on to professional studies in law, medicine, or
theology. The Jesuit philosophical curriculum was based on the philosophy of
Aristotle, and divided into the then-standard topics of logic, morals, physics,
and metaphysics. The Jesuits also included mathematics in the final three years
of study.

Descartes had mixed things to say about his time at La Fleche. 

> From my childhood I have been nourished upon letters, and because I
> was persuaded that by their means one could acquire a clear and certain
> knowledge of all that is useful in life, I was extremely eager to learn them.
> But as soon as I had completed the course of study at the end of which one is
> normally admitted to the ranks of the learned, I completely changed my
> opinion. For I found myself beset by so many doubts and errors that I came to
> think I had gained nothing from my attempts to become educated but increasing
> recognition of my ignorance. (*Discourse* I; AT VI:4-5)

Descartes then leavens this by saying that "I did not, however, cease to value
the exercises done in the Schools." (AT VI:5). As we learn in the *Discourse*,
Descartes regarded the teachings at La Fleche as useful but uncertain, in large
part due to their lack of a secure method for acquiring knowledge. The
articulation of such a method is regarded by Descartes as one of his most
significant contributions to science (more on that below).

Descartes studied to be a lawyer, but then joined the army after getting his
degree. In the winter of 1619, while returning from Frankfurt to witness the
coronation of
[Ferdinand II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor),
Descartes was stranded by a storm. During his time waiting out the storm
Descartes had a series of dreams whose content determined him to set out a new
foundation for knowledge, and specifically, a new metaphysics from which the
details of physics and a philosophy of nature more generally could be derived.

Eventually, Descartes moved to the Netherlands (1629) and settled there. He had
one daughter, by a servant (Helene), whom he named Francine. Unfortunately the
daughter died young. Descartes is rumored to have carried a doll made in her
size and likeness with him on his travels. By 1648 he had attained some fame on
the European continent, and was invited by Queen Christina of Sweden to be her
tutor. He accepted and moved to Sweden in 1649. There he was required to give
her instruction in philosophy at five in the morning, for five hours at a time,
three days a week. It is speculated that the early morning regimen, to which
Descartes was unaccustomed, along with the cold weather, contributed to his
contracting a respiratory infection that led to his death on the 11^th^ of
February, 1650. He was fifty-three years old.

# Philosophical Work #

For a general overview of Descartes's work see [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/) and [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/).

Descartes made significant contributions in mathematics (e.g. the algebraic
method used to develop
[analytic geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry); cf.
@boyer2011, 309-12), in optics, and in physics. We shall discuss two major works
of his, viz., The *Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason
and Seeking Truth in the Sciences*, and the *Meditations on First Philosophy*.
Below I give a very general overview of the *Discourse* and the *Meditations*.

## The *Discourse on the Method* (1637) ##

The *Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and Seeking
Truth in the Sciences* was written over a period of several years and published
(in French) in 1637, when Descartes was 41. It combined discussion of scientific
methodology with a series of arguments, in accordance with that offered
methodology, all aimed at articulating a metaphysical foundation for physics.

The *Discourse* is Descartes's first published work, and comes approximately
four years after he had abandoned work on a scientific treatise he title *The
World*, largely due to worries concerning possible religious persecution for the
doctrines espoused within. In the end Descartes decided to try and
repackage many of his arguments without some of the more controversial material,
and thus we have the *Discourse*. 

The *Discourse* provides background concerning Descartes's early education and
his motivation for articulating a precise method for acquiring knowledge. The
*Discourse* also contains parts of the previous and unfinished *World*,
including a work on optics (the *Dioptrics*), and works on meteorology and
geometry.

The *Discourse* consists of six parts. Part I of the *Discourse* is
autobiographical, setting out how Descartes came to think that there was a
need for a new method in gaining knowledge. In Part II, Descartes suggests
that the surest way to knowledge is via a radical reconstruction of one's
beliefs, allowing to remain only those of which one was certain.

> regarding the opinions to which I had hitherto given credence, I thought that I
> could not do better than undertake to get rid of them, all at one go, in order
> to replace them afterwards with better ones, or with the same ones once I had
> squared them with the standards of reason. I firmly believed that in this way
> I would succeed in conducting my life much better than if I built only upon old
> foundations and relied only upon principles that I had accepted in my youth
> without ever examining whether they were true. (*Discourse* II; AT VI:13-14)

Descartes was partly motivated in this radical reconstruction by his
mathematical discoveries. In particular, he had become convinced by his
aforementioned mathematical discoveries concerning the algebraic representation
and solution of both geometric and arithmetical problems that the barriers to
knowledge were largely methodological in nature. This led to his being convinced
of the existence of an underlying discipline of which geometry, arithmetic,
astronomy, and the theory of harmony were all expressions (@gaukroger2006a,
59-60). He called this discipline *mathesis universalis* or "universal
mathematics." Ultimately, Descartes believed that there was an even more
fundamental basis for the method used by his universal mathematics. This is the
method which he first articulates in the unpublished *Rules for the Direction of
our Native Intelligence* (1628) and then presents in a more condensed fashion in
part two of the *Discourse*. Here Descartes sets out four rules for ordering
one's thoughts and acquiring knowledge:

> The first was never to accept anything as true if I did not have evident
> knowledge of its truth: that is, carefully to avoid precipitate conclusions
> and preconceptions, and to include nothing more in my judgements than what
> presented itself to my mind so clearly and so distinctly that I had no
> occasion to doubt it.

> The second, to divide each of the difficulties I
> examined into as many parts as possible and as may be required in order to
> resolve them better.

> The third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly manner, by
> beginning with the simplest and most easily known objects in order to ascend
> little by little, step by step, to knowledge of the most complex, and by
> supposing 19 some order even among objects that have no natural order of
> precedence.

> And the last, throughout to make enumerations so complete, and
> reviews so comprehensive, that I could be sure of leaving nothing out. (AT
> VI:18-19)

It is this method that Descartes follows in the *Meditations* in order that he
may provide a proper foundation for natural science.

Part III of the *Discourse* discusses practical and moral considerations of
adhering to these rules. Part IV offers arguments for the existence of God and
the soul, which form the basis of his metaphysical foundation for physics. These
arguments will be revisited in the *Meditations*. Part V lays out some aspects
of Descartes's theory of matter, his physics, and some discussion of his
biological theory. Finally, in Part VI, Descartes discusses aspects of his views
and their relation to the recently censured views of Galileo, as well as his
reasons for publishing the *Discourse* in the manner that he did.

The Appendices of the *Discourse* are from Descartes's unpublished work, "*The
World*" (1633), which he wrote in the hopes of providing a unified physical
theory of nature (the human being, the Earth, and the heavens). Gary Hatfield (a
historian of philosophy) describes the significance of the work thusly,

>Descartes went far beyond the Copernican hypothesis that our Sun lies at the
>center of the universe with the Earth moving about it. He contended that the
>Earth is one among many planets, revolving around many different suns
>distributed throughout the cosmos. He further proposed that the whole universe
>is made of one kind of matter, which follows one set of laws. He invented the
>concept of a single universe, filled with matter having a few describable
>properties and governed by a few laws of motion. While others, including
>ancient [Greek] atomists and Stoics, had sketched part of this new picture,
>Descartes’ vision of a unified physics governed by a few laws of motion was far
>richer and more detailed. Its combination of breadth and unity was
>unprecedented in his earlier work with Beeckman, or in the works of Copernicus,
>Galileo, or Kepler. This unified vision set the framework for Newton’s
>subsequent unification of mechanics and astronomy. (@hatfield2003, 18)

When Descartes was nearing completion of *The World* in 1633, he learned of the
Catholic church's condemnation of Galileo for defending the Copernican
hypothesis that the Earth orbited the sun. Not wanting to be branded a criminal
by the church Descartes decided not to publish the work and contemplated burning
all of his papers. *The World* was eventually published after Descartes's death
in 1664.

## The *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641) ##

In 1647 Descartes published a French version of his Latin work *Principles of
Philosophy* (1644), in which he laid out his philosophical system. In the
preface to this translation he famously compares the structure of his theory to
a tree, whose different parts represent the different sciences.

>The first part of philosophy is metaphysics, which contains the principles of
>knowledge, including the explanation of the principal attributes of God, the
>non-material nature of our souls and all the clear and distinct notions which
>are in us. The second part is physics, where, after discovering the true
>principles of material things, we examine the general composition of the entire
>universe and then, in particular, the nature of this earth and all the bodies
>which are most commonly found upon it, such as air, water, fire, magnetic ore
>and other minerals. Next we need to examine individually the nature of plants,
>of animals and, above all, of man, so that we may be capable later on of
>discovering the other sciences which are beneficial to man. Thus the whole of
>philosophy is like a tree. The roots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and
>the branches emerging from the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be
>reduced to three principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals. By
>'morals' I understand the highest and most perfect moral system, which
>presupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences and is the ultimate
>level of wisdom. (AT 9B:14 in @descartes1985, 186)

The *Meditations*, published in Latin in 1641, was Descartes attempt to argue
for the foundations of his physics, and thus the "roots" of all human knowledge,
in a systematic way, while also presenting his views in a manner that he hoped
would be congenial to traditional scholastic philosophy (he hoped for, but never
received, the endorsement of the Jesuits). It is, by and large, an elaboration
of the arguments presented in part four of the *Discourse*, which preceded his
discussion in part five (and the appendices) of the nature of the natural world.
It thus articulates, at least according to Descartes, all the principles
required for the metaphysical basis (the roots of the tree) of his physics, and
the other natural sciences more generally.

However, Descartes himself does not present the argument of the *Meditations* in
this way. Instead, Descartes highlights, in the subtitle to the work, the proofs
it contains of God's existence, and of the distinctness of soul from body. In
his letter to the church faculty of the Sorbonne, Descartes even goes so far as
to suggest that the primary aim of the work is to help convert "unbelievers"
(i.e. atheists) (AT 7:1-2). However, to Marin Mersenne, one of his confidants in
Paris, Descartes writes:

>I will say to you, just between us, that these six Meditations contain all the
>foundations of my Physics. But, please, you must not say so; for those who
>favor Aristotle would perhaps have more difficulty in approving them; and I
>hope that those who will read them will unwittingly become accustomed to my
>principles, and will recognize the truth, before they notice that my principles
>destroy those of Aristotle. (AT 3:297–8 in @descartes1991, 173)

So, despite hoping to win favor with various schools of scholastic
Aristotelianism, the Jesuits in particular, Descartes nevertheless took himself
to be articulating a theory diametrically opposed to Aristotle's (and the
medieval scholastic versions thereof).

The *Meditations* consists of six parts, each of which takes up a different but
related topic. In order, they are (1) the aims of the work and the method of
doubt; (2) the *cogito* and our knowledge of body; (3) proof of God's existence;
(4) judgment and error; (5) another proof of God's existence; (6) the real
distinction between mind and body and knowledge of the external world.

In the course of discussing these topics, Descartes argues that matter has
essential features wholly different from those put forth by Aristotlelian
philosophy. He will also argue that the mind and body are wholly distinct and
different substances. He thus fundamentally denies the hylomorphism used by the
medievals to argue that the human being as well as other material bodies are
composites of matter and substantial form.

### Method & the Meditations ###

Recall that Descartes's method has four parts: (1) accepting as true only that
for which one has proper evidence---viz., clear and vivid ideas; (2) resolving
problems into their simplest parts; (3) moving from the simple and known to the
complex; and (4) thoroughly reviewing and checking one’s work to be sure it is
comprehensive and complete. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Descartes was a
mathematician, this method is well suited to mathematical practice. But it was
one of Descartes's hopes that he might resolve many of the disputes to which
metaphysics was prone by bringing the methods of mathematics to it.

The *Meditations* carries out Descartes's method in a fairly straightforward
manner. First, (as is clear from *Meditation I*) Descartes follows a "method of
doubt" so to accept only what is vividly and clearly perceived to be true.
Second, he attempts to resolve the fundamental issues of metaphysics into the
simplest parts possible, which he then (third) pursues in increasing order of
complexity. Finally (fourth), in reviewing his whole argument, by the end of the
*Meditations* he purports to have given us an argument that provides the
complete basic principles of philosophy.

### The Meditation as Literary Form ###

It is important to note that, despite Descartes's insistence on bringing
mathematical methods to bear on issues of fundamental philosophy, he does not
present the work in mathematical form. Instead, he presents his arguments in a
series of 'meditations.' The meditation as literary form was a
[common trope of medieval philosophy and theology](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-literary/#MedSol).
Typically, the style is introspective, and often as a dialog with oneself or
[with God](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#ReaCon). There is
supposed to be personal and/or spiritual growth as the meditations progress.
This also goes along with the important first-person aspect of Descartes's
*Meditations*, which raises the question of who the 'I' refers to in the
*Meditations* proper. Is it Descartes? This seems unlikely, as the winter storm
in which he is trapped in the small cottage by the stove occurs in 1619, at
least nine years before he develops his metaphysical system. What's more,
Descartes clearly does not himself think some of the things which the Meditator
does, such as that the senses are the primary basis of all knowledge. So perhaps
the Meditator is supposed to be someone else?---perhaps the reader?

Whatever the answers to these questions, it seems clear that the Meditator is
supposed to take an intellectual journey in the course of proceeding through
each section of the work so that, in the end, he or she comes to a proper
understanding of the truth---viz. the truth of the Cartesian metaphysical
system.
