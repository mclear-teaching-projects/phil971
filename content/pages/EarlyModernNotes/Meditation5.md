# The Structure of *Meditation* 5

1.  Essence of matter is extension (7:63, 71)
2.  Innate ideas of essences (7:63–5)
3.  Ontological argument (7:65–8)
4.  Primacy of clear and distinct perception (7:68–9)
5.  Knowledge of God needed to banish doubt (7:69–71)

Descartes begins by asking whether "any certainty can be achieved regarding
material objects" (7:63). This leads him first to make a claim about the essence
of matter.

# The Essence of Matter

The essence of matter is "continuous quantity" or extension

> Quantity, for example, or 'continuous' quantity as the philosophers commonly
> call it, is something I distinctly imagine. That is, I distinctly imagine the
> extension of the quantity (or rather of the thing which is quantified) in
> length, breadth and depth. I also enumerate various parts of the thing, and to
> these parts I assign various sizes, shapes, positions and local motions; and
> to the motions I assign various durations. (7:63)

One innovation here is that Descartes argues that we can know the essence of a
thing whether or not we know that it exists. In this sense knowledge of essence
is independent of knowledge of existence. This is in contrast to the
Aristotelian conception according to which knowledge of essence is something
'abstracted' from our experience of objects in the world.

## Essence as Primary Attribute

What is it to say that the essence or primary attribute of matter is extension?
In the *Principles*, Descartes explains that each substance has a “principal
attribute” or “property” that “constitutes its nature and essence, and to which
all its other properties are referred” (8A:25). This means that all of the
properties of a thing---including all its modes---are to be "referred" to some
primary property, without which that thing would not be what it is. In the case
of body (i.e. matter), the primary attribute or "essence" is extension.

Descartes seems to be making two claims here. The first concerns the
intelligible structure of a thing. In reasoning about or understanding what a
thing is, Descartes claims, we must be able to make connections between the
various qualities attributed to a thing. If we cannot then we will not be able
to understand what the thing is and why it is that way. In the case of body,
Descartes is claiming that our understanding of any body requires thinking of it
as first and foremost, an extended thing. All other properties attributed to a
body must therefore be understood in relation to its being extended, and
ultimately just as *ways of its being extended*.

Descartes is thus making, aside from the above claim about intelligibility, a
metaphysical claim as well---viz. that the property of being extended is the
most metaphysically fundamental property a material substance can have, and is
the property upon which all of its other properties rely.

## Essence Generalized

After claiming to have articulated the essence of body, Descartes goes on to
make a series of more general claims about how one might come to knowledge of
the essence of a thing independently of any issue of its existence. We might
come to have knowledge of the "true and immutable nature" (7:64) of a thing by
reflection on our idea of it. The content of this idea need not have come from
anything outside the subject---it could be innate. Moreover, its content is "not
invented by me [the meditator] or dependent on my mind" (7:45). The mark of this
is somewhat psychological. Descartes notes that with respect to such ideas (e.g.
geometric ideas) they seem not invented but rather *discovered*. They are truths
which the mind recognizes whether it wants to or not (7:64). This point, that
one can have knowledge of the essence of a thing just by contemplating clear and
distinct idea, and that this can give one knowledge of it is then put to work
with respect to the idea of God and of God's essence.

# The Ontological Argument

## Structure of the Argument

1.  Statement of the ontological argument (7:65)
2.  Objection 1: existence is separable from essence (7:66)
3.  Objection 2: existence in thought is different from real existence
    (7:66)
4.  Objection 3: the necessity of God's existence is only hypothetical
    (7:67)

## The Argument

The
[ontological argument](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-%20ontological/)
differs from Descartes's previous proofs in that it purports to prove God's
existence simply from an innate and clear and distinct idea of God's essence. So
this isn't a proof that relies on the cause of the idea, or on the finitude or
preservation of the subject.

> if the mere fact that I can produce from my thought the idea of something
> entails that everything which I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to
> that thing really does belong to it, is not this a possible basis for another
> argument to prove the existence of God? Certainly, the idea of God, or a
> supremely perfect being, is one which I find within me just as surely as the
> idea of any shape or number, And my understanding that it belongs to his
> nature that he always exists) is no less clear and distinct than is the case
> when I prove of any shape or number that some property belongs to its nature.
> Hence, even if it turned out that not everything on which I have meditated in
> these past days is true, I ought still to regard the existence of God as
> having at least the same level certainty as I have hitherto attributed to the
> truths of mathematics. (7:65)

The proof differs from
[previous versions](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/) of
the ontological argument, in that it does not depend on an arbitrary definition
of God but rather an innate idea whose content is clearly and distinctly
perceived. Thus, just as one can come to know basic geometrical truths by
reflecting on the content of geometric ideas, Descartes thinks one also comes to
know that God exists, just by reflection on the content of one's idea of God.

## Three Objections

### Existence and Essence

The first objection is that we readily distinguish between the essence of a
thing, what it is for that thing to be the kind of thing it is, and the
existence of a thing. A ready example of this can be seen in geometry.
Geometrical figures, as described by, e.g. Euclid, have essences. That is, they
have definite characteristics that categorize them as the things they are
(triangles have three sides and angles that sum to 180˚, quadrilateral figures
have four sides and angles that sum to 360˚, etc.). However, it would be wrong
to say that, for these figures, their essence is inseperable from their
existence. For a particular geometric figure, we can distinguish what
characteristics is must necessarily have *were it to exist* even when conceding
that the figure *may not actually exist*. If we can make this distinction in the
case of geometric figures, then why not with God? Descartes puts the objection
this way:

> Since I have been accustomed to distinguish between existence and essence in
> everything else, I find it easy to persuade myself that existence can also be
> separated from the essence of God, and hence that God can be thought of as not
> existing (7:66)

Descartes then replies that careful consideration of the content of the idea
of God shows us that God's essence is inseparable from its existence.

> when I concentrate more carefully, it is quite evident that existence can no
> more be separated from the essence of God than the fact that its three angles
> equal two right angles can be separated from the essence of a triangle, or than
> the idea of a mountain can be separated from the idea of a valley. Hence it is
> just as much of a contradiction to think of God (that is, a supremely perfect
> being) lacking existence (that is, lacking a perfection), as it is to think of a
> mountain without a valley (7:66)

Here we get a clarification of Descartes's view. The reason why it would be
self-contradictory to think of God as lacking existence is because existence,
according to Descartes, is a perfection, and God essentially (i.e. as part of
God's essence) has all perfections, so God must exist.

### Real or Fictitious?

The next objection worries about how we can be sure that the content of
our ideas matches reality.

> even granted that I cannot think of God except as existing, just as I cannot
> think of a mountain without a valley, it certainly does not follow from the
> fact that I think of a mountain with a valley that there is any mountain in
> the world; and similarly, it does nor seem to follow from the fact that I
> think of God as existing that he does exist. For my thought does not impose
> any necessity on things; and just as I may imagine a winged horse even though
> no horse has wings, so I may be able to attach existence to God even though no
> God exists. (7:66)

So the objection asks (i) whether it would follow simply from one's
thought that God exists that He exists, which (ii) seems fallacious
given other examples of fictitious thought, such as thinking of a winged
horse.

Descartes replies that this objection gets things the wrong way round.

> there is a sophism concealed here [i.e. in the above argument]. From the fact
> that I cannot think of a mountain without a valley, it does not follow that a
> mountain and valley exist anywhere, but simply that a mountain and a
> valley, whether they exist or not, are mutually inseparable. But from the fact
> that I cannot think of God except as existing, it follows that existence is
> inseparable from God, and hence that he really exists. It is not that my
> thought makes it so, or imposes any necessity on any thing; on the contrary,
> it is the necessity of the thing itself, namely the existence of God, which
> determines my thinking in this respect. For I am not free to think of God
> without existence (that is, a supremely perfect being without a supreme
> perfection) as I am free to imagine a horse with or without wings. (7:66-7)

Descartes denies that his claim is that thinking makes it so---the
necessity of God's features constrain our thinking concerning them.
Descartes also denies that the connection could be merely fictitious. If
it were then the connection would be under the thinker's control, in the
way that thinking of a horse as winged (or not) is under the thinker's
control. Hence, Descartes assumes that thought of fictitious connections
is always subject to the thinker's will, while what is intrinsically
connected will be inseperable in thought.

### Hypothetical Necessity

Descartes then goes on to pose a third objection:

> [Assuming that] while it is indeed necessary for me to suppose God exists, once
> I have made the supposition that he has all perfections (since existence is
> one of the perfections), nevertheless the original supposition was not
> necessary. Similarly, the objection would run, it is not necessary for me
> to think that all quadrilaterals can be inscribed in a circle; but given this
> supposition, it will be necessary for me to admit that a rhombus can be
> inscribed in a circle -- which is patently false. (7:67)

In other words, if we assume that God has all perfections, and that
existence is such a perfection, then Descartes's conclusion follows. But
why make these assumptions? What justifies them?

Descartes's reply again draws on the distinction between the content of
a fictitious idea, whose characterisitcs may be seperated at will, and
the content of the idea of God, which necessarily posits God's possession
of all perfections, including existence.

> Now admittedly, it is not necessary that I ever light upon any thought of God;
> but whenever I do choose to think of the first and supreme being, and bring
> forth the idea of God from the treasure house of my mind as it were, it is
> necessary that I attribute all perfections to him, even if I do not at that
> time enumerate them or attend to them individually. And this necessity plainly
> guarantees that, when I later realize that existence is a perfection, I am
> correct in inferring that the first and supreme being exists. In the same way,
> it is not necessary for me ever to imagine a triangle; but whenever I do wish
> to consider a rectilinear figure having just three angles, it is necessary
> that I attribute to it the properties which license the inference that its
> three angles equal no more than two right angles, even if I do not notice this
> at the time. By contrast, when I examine what figures can be inscribed in a
> circle, it is in no way necessary for me to think that this class includes all
> quadrilaterals. Indeed, I cannot even imagine this, so long as I an willing to
> admit only what I clearly and distinctly understand. So there is a great
> difference between this kind of false supposition and the true ideas which are
> innate in me, of which the first and most important is the idea of God. (7:67-8)

So the idea of God includes the concept `<existence>`, in the just the same
(necessary) way that the idea of a triangle includes `<three sided>`. We know
that "This idea isn’t a fiction, a creature of my thought, but rather an image
of a true and unchanging nature" because we have a clear and distinct perception
of it.

## Caterus's Objection

> Even if it is granted that a supremely perfect being carries the implication of
> existence in virtue of its very title, it still does not follow that the
> existence in question is anything actual in the real world; all that follows
> is that the concept of existence is inseparably linked to the concept of a
> supreme being. So you cannot infer that the existence of God is anything actual
> unless you supposes that the supreme being actually exists; for then it will
> actually contain all perfections, including the perfection of real existence.
> (7:99; CAM p. 136)

In other words, do we really know that such a being exists that corresponds to
our concept? Descartes takes the objection to be a version of the second
objection discussed above---viz., whether the concept of God is fictional, in
the sense of being constructed out of other materials (e.g. our experience of
finite beings from which we extrapolate). But Caterus seems to be objecting to
the claim that the necessity to which we attach the concept `<existence>` to the
concept `<God>` must track or mirror some real relation of God's existence in
reality. Caterus is thus not objecting to the claim Descartes makes concerning
the connection of the two concepts `<existence>` and `<God>`. Instead he is
objecting to the claim that this conceptual connection is a sufficient basis for
making a claim about an extra-mental reality---viz. that *God* (the being) and
*existence* (the property) really are so connected.

Caterus's objection is especially pressing, given that for Descartes the idea of
God is innate. The question is thus how an innate idea, an idea that does not
originate from the external world, could nevertheless accurately reflect
reality. This worry holds as much for geometrical figures, which determine the
essential properties of all material beings, as it does for God.

To that extent that Descartes has resources to defend his version of the
ontological argument, the defense hinges on his fundamental claim that clear and
distinct ideas, despite their being innate, provide us with an adequate
representation of reality. This would seem to point to the truth rule -- the
idea that clear and distinct ideas are true and sufficient for knowledge. Hence,
we have to consider the justification for the truth rule, if there is any.

# The Cartesian Circle

As was suggested in the discussion of the *Third Meditation*, the need for a
proof of God hinges, at least in part, on the need for a certification of clear
and distinct ideas as guaranteeing truth. At the end of the *Fifth Meditation*
Descartes makes clear that such a proof is necessary if we are to achieve
certainty of even the simplest things, such as basic mathematical truths.

> Now, however, I have perceived that God exists, and at the same time I have
> understood that everything else depends on him, and that he is no deceiver;
> and I have drawn the conclusion that everything which I clearly and distinctly
> perceive is of necessity true. Accordingly, even if I am no longer attending
> to the arguments which led me to judge that this is true, as long as I
> remember that I clearly and distinctly perceived it, there are no
> counter-arguments which can be adduced to make me doubt it, but on the
> contrary I have true and certain knowledge of it. And I have knowledge not
> just of this matter, but of all matters which I remember ever having
> demonstrated, in geometry and so on...Thus I see plainly that the certainty
> and truth of all knowledge depends uniquely on my awareness of the true God,
> to such an extent that I was incapable of perfect knowledge about anything
> else until I became aware of him. (7:70-1)

In the *Third Meditation* Descartes argued that his clear and distinct idea of
God grounded certainty of God's existence. God's existence and nature were then
used to ground the truth rule. Arnauld, in the *Fourth Objections* points out
that this reasoning is circular.

> I have one further worry, namely how [Descartes] avoids reasoning in a circle
> when he says that we are sure that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is
> true only because God exists. But we can be sure that God exists only because
> we distinctly and clearly perceive this. Hence, before we can be sure that God
> exists we ought to be able to be sure that whatever we perceive clearly and
> evidently is true. (7:214; CSM p. 142)

Descartes's reply relies on the distinction between knowledge, at a time,
derived from one's clear and distinct ideas, and knowledge at some later time
based on the *memory* of such a derivation (7:246; CSM 142-3). Descartes argues
that the *proof* of God relies only the on the clear and distinct idea of God,
while the subject's capacity to *retain* knowledge (but not the reliability of
clear and distinct ideas themselves), such as through memory, relies on the the
proof of God's existence, and the fact that He is no deceiver.

Is this a convincing means of getting out of the circle?
