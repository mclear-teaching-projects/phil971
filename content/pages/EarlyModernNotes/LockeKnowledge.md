Locke has a scholastic conception of knowledge proper, just as Descartes does,
but unlike Descartes, Locke thinks such knowledge is achievable in ethics and
mathematics only, and thus, contra Descartes, not in metaphysics or natural
science.

# The Nature of Knowledge

Locke defines knowledge as a relation between our ideas:

> Since the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other immediate
> object but its own ideas, which it alone does or can contemplate, it is
> evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them...Knowledge then
> seems to me to be nothing but the perception of the connexion of and
> agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our ideas. In this alone
> it consists. (IV.i.1-2)

There are three points of note here. First, that knowledge is a relation between
*ideas*, not (at least in any immediate way) between a knower and the world.
While this may be fine for stipulative knowledge (or even a priori knowledge
generally), such as that a bachelor is an unmarried male, it does not seem to
fit with existential knowledge of contingent matters, such as the color of one’s
shirt, or that one had French toast for breakfast. These seems to be cases where
one has knowledge of matters of fact or of particular individuals and their
characteristics, rather than one’s ideas of them.

Second, Locke puts significant emphasis on the subject’s own *perception* of the
agreement or disagreement of their ideas. Hence, for as subject to count as a
knower, she must herself perceive, or be in a position to perceive, the
requisite agreement or disagreement between her ideas. Locke’s
[political philosophy](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-political/)
emphasizes the authority and sovereignty with respect to matters of right, and
this same emphasis can be seen in the importance of one’s subjective perception
for knowledge. For Locke, one cannot know things whose justification or evidence
is taken merely on the authority of another (whether that be friend, parent,
church, or state). One’s ultimate status as a knower stands or falls with the
relation to one’s own ideas and not anyone else’s.

Third, Locke’s conception of knowledge, properly so called, ties knowledge to
*certainty*. If one knows that *p* then one is certain that *p*. Here the notion
of certainty is not that of a mere subjective state of conviction, it is rather
*factive* — being certain that *p* entails that *p* is true. This means that
there is no knowledge, properly so called, in cases where there is merely the
*probability* of *p*’s being true. This high standard for knowledge is something
Locke shares with both Descartes and with the Aristotelian scholastic tradition.

A further point, not made explicitly in the passage above, is that the
connections that Locke has in mind concerning our ideas are *necessary*
connections. He makes this point more clearly in his discussion of the
limitations of our knowledge concerning the natural world.

> I fear the weakness of human understanding is scarce able to substitute
> another [than the corpuscularian hypothesis], which will afford us a fuller
> and clearer discovery of the necessary connexion and coexistence of the powers
> which are to be observed united in several sorts of [bodies]...I doubt
> whether, with those faculties we have, we shall ever be able to carry our
> general knowledge (I say not particular experience) in this part much further. (IV.iii.16)

Knowledge is concerned with the necessary connections between ideas, and
ultimately, between qualities in the bodies causing those ideas in us. But,
Locke argues, we can have no knowledge of these necessary connections, and can
only frame hypotheses concerning their possible nature (Locke’s favorite being
the corpuscularian hypothesis).

## Varieties of Agreement/Disagreement

If knowledge is agreement or disagreement between ideas, one might ask
whether all such relationships are of the same form. Locke thinks that
there are in fact four general categories into which such
agreement/disagreement might fall.

1.  Identity, or diversity
    -   in virtue of perceiving an idea one is aware that each idea is
        identical with itself and different from others (IV.i.4)

2.  Relation
    -   perception of relations between ideas, even if only juxtaposing
        them in a single thought (IV.i.5)

3.  Co-existence, or necessary connection
    -   ideas of characteristics being necessarily connected in a single
        entity, such as the color and texture of a particular piece of
        gold (IV.i.6)

4.  Real existence
    -   perception of the actual existence of something. We have
        intuitive knowledge of our own existence, and know the existence
        of mind-independent objects via sensation (IV.xi.1)

> ‘Blue is not yellow’ is of identity; ‘Two triangles on equal bases
> between two parallells are equal’ is of relation; ‘Iron is
> magnetizable’ is of co-existence; and ‘God exists’ is of real
> existence. Though identity and co-existence are themselves relations,
> they are such special kinds of agreement or disagreement amongst ideas
> that they deserve to be brought in separately, not under relation in
> general. (IV.i.7)

## ‘Degrees’ of Knowledge

Locke also distinguishes between types or ‘degrees’ of knowledge. Another way of
putting this is to say that though, for Locke, all knowledge is marked by a
particular kind of *perception* of agreement or incompatibility between ideas,
there are nevertheless different routes to such perception, different ways of
the agreement’s being evident (IV.ii.14).

The most certain is ‘intuitive’ knowledge, which is phenomenologically
immediate, and non-inferential.

> Sometimes our mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
> immediately—by themselves, without the intervention of any other : and this I
> think we may call this intuitive knowledge…[in such knowledge] the mind
> perceives that white is not black, that a circle is not a triangle, that three
> are more than two and equal to one plus two. Such kinds of truths the mind
> perceives at the first sight of the ideas together, by bare intuition; without
> the intervention of any other idea: and this kind of knowledge is the clearest
> and most certain that human frailty is capable of. (IV.ii.1)

The second kind of knowledge is ‘demonstrative’ knowledge, which is mediated by
inferences involving intermediate ideas.

> The next degree of knowledge occurs when the mind perceives the agreement or
> disagreement of any ideas, but not immediately…The reason why the mind cannot
> always perceive presently the agreement or disagreement of two ideas, is,
> because those ideas, concerning whose agreement or disagreement the inquiry is
> made, cannot by the mind be so put together as to show it. In this case then,
> when the mind cannot so bring its ideas together as by their immediate
> comparison, and as it were juxtaposition or application to one another, to
> perceive their agreement or disagreement, it is fain, by the intervention of
> other ideas...to discover the agreement or disagreement which it searches; and
> this is what we call *reasoning*. (IV.ii.2)

Proofs are understood by Locke to be the means by which we reason to our
intended conclusion, and the successful knowledge-yielding proof is a
'demonstration.'

Demonstrative knowledge, though certain, is nevertheless less obvious or
convincing than intuitive knowledge, partly due to limitations in our ability to
remember and hold before us all the relevant steps of a proof.

> to make anything a demonstration, it is necessary to perceive the immediate
> agreement of the intervening ideas, whereby the agreement or disagreement of
> the two ideas under examination (whereof the one is always the first, and the
> other the last in the account) is found. This intuitive perception of the
> agreement or disagreement of the intermediate ideas, in each step and
> progression of the demonstration, must also be carried exactly in the mind,
> and a man must be sure that no part is left out: which, because in long
> deductions, and the use of many proofs, the memory does not always so readily
> and exactly retain; therefore it comes to pass, that this is more imperfect
> than intuitive knowledge, and men embrace often falsehood for demonstrations.
> (IV.ii.7)

Anything that falls short of intuition or demonstration is not itself knowledge,
properly so called. It is instead either ‘Belief’ or ‘Opinion’ (IV.ii.14). Locke
makes an exception, however, for what he calls ‘sensitive knowledge’, which is
less certain than either intuitive or demonstrative knowledge but which is
something other than a claim whose truth is merely probable.

> There is, indeed, another perception of the mind, employed about the
> particular existence of finite beings without us, which, going beyond bare
> probability, and yet not reaching perfectly to either of the foregoing degrees
> of certainty, passes under the name of knowledge. There can be nothing more
> certain than that the idea we receive from an external object is in our minds:
> this is intuitive knowledge. (IV.ii.14)

The obvious question, with respect to sensitive knowledge, is whether it is
correct to think of it as genuine *knowledge* of the existence of
mind-independent objects. What about the kinds of skeptical doubts raised by
Descartes in the the initial stages of the *Meditations*? Locke thinks that we
have intuitive certainty of the existence of our ideas of external objects
(IV.ii.14), the question is whether we know of the existence of those objects
themselves. Locke raises and answers the questions as follows:

> whether there be anything more than barely that idea in our minds; whether we
> can thence certainly infer the existence of anything without us, which
> corresponds to that idea, is that whereof some men think there may be a
> question made; because men may have such ideas in their minds, when no such
> thing exists, no such object affects their senses. But yet here I think we are
> provided with an evidence that puts us past doubting. For I ask any one, [1]
> Whether he be not invincibly conscious to himself of a different perception,
> when he looks on the sun by day, and thinks on it by night; when he actually
> tastes wormwood, or smells a rose, or only thinks on that savour or odour? [2]
> We as plainly find the difference there is between any idea revived in our
> minds by our own memory, and actually coming into our minds by our senses, as
> we do between any two distinct ideas. If any one say, a dream may do the same
> thing, and all these ideas may be produced in us without any external objects;
> he may please to dream that I make him this answer:— [3] 1. That it is no
> great matter, whether I remove his scruple or no: where all is but dream,
> reasoning and arguments are of no use, truth and knowledge nothing. [4] 2.
> That I believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dreaming of
> being in the fire, and being actually in it. (IV.ii.14)

I’ve marked out four distinct issues Locke raises concerning skeptical doubt of
the existence of an external world. We’ll take them in turn.

First, Locke points out that there is a distinctive phenomenology to our
perceptions that cannot be replicated in thought. This is clearly correct, but
doesn’t tell us anything about the veracity of our perceptions, which is what
was in question.

Second, Locke points out that there is a clear difference, again, presumably
phenomenologically, between memory and an occurrent perception. Locke is surely
correct that we do not typically confuse our memories with occurrent experience,
but it is not obvious that a memory and an occurrent experience could never be
phenomenally indistinguishable. In abnormal circumstances one might have
especially vivid memories that, at least in some respects, might closely if not
exactly resemble the original experience. And once again, even if memory is
always distinguishable from occurrent perception, this does not show that
occurrent perception is giving any sort of cognitive access to things without
the mind.

Third, Locke simply denies that anything like reasoning or argument would matter
if our epistemic status were on par with dreaming. This is not so much an
argument against the possibility that we are radically deceived, as we might be
if dreaming, as it is the claim that if we are so deceived, then arguments don’t
matter.

Finally, in the fourth point Locke quips that there is something very obviously
different between being in a fire and dreaming or hallucinating being in a fire.
This is obviously correct. One is painful, the other isn’t (or not as much).
There are also clear differences in practical import. Presumably, actually being
in the middle of a fire would lead to all sorts of (avoidance) behaviors that
merely dreaming or hallucinating being in the fire might not. Has Locke made a
significant point here? Not obviously. Descartes is quite clear that his concern
is with slight or ‘metaphysical’ doubt that may have no practical import at all
(7:22).

What comes through most clearly in these arguments is Locke’s disdain for the
question. He has not, it seems, given any satisfactory answer to the question as
to whether an external world really exists, but he doesn’t seem to think it a
serious or pressing question.

Note though, that sensitive knowledge is not very extensive. Locke considers it
to extend no further than our actual occurrent sensory experience (IV.iii.5).
Hence, neither remembered past sensory experience, nor possible future sensory
experience is available for underwriting knowledge of the external world. Thus,
whatever knowledge we may have of particular occurrent existent things via sense
experience, it will be limited to the present moment of consciousness.

# The Prospects for Scientific Knowledge

Our contemporary notion of scientific knowledge only came into existence in the
19th century. The term ‘scientist’ was coined in 1834 by
[William Whewell](http://bit.ly/1VOoqdj). Before then, and going back to
[Aristotle](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle/), the dominant
conception of theoretical knowledge, known as ‘*Scientia*’ (Greek:
‘*Epistêmê*’), concerned any organized body of knowledge which demonstrated
necessary connections between known truths. Scientific knowledge could be stated
in syllogistic argument, reasoning from more fundamental truths, to the truths
(logically) derivable from them.

We’ll look both at the notion of a *scientia* as a system of logical
demonstrations and Locke’s pessimism that natural science could ever satisfy
such stringent requirements. One of Locke’s great contributions to epistemology
was carving out a way between the traditional and highly demanding notion of
scientific knowledge and a resolute skepticism. Locke attempted to articulate a
notion of human knowledge as limited and finite, but as more than mere
skepticism. For more extensive discussion see
[Kochiras (2013)](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke-philosophy-science/).

## The Ideal of Demonstrative Knowledge

Aristotle puts the notion of scientific knowledge this way:

> We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing,
> as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows,
> when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause
> of that fact and of no other, and, further, that the fact could not be other
> than it is….The proper object of unqualified scientific knowledge is something
> which cannot be other than it is. [@aristotle1993, I.2]

So, according to Aristotle (and here the scholastics follow him), scientific
knowledge is knowledge of asymmetric dependence relations that hold necessarily
(in some sense of 'necessary'). Typically, the sense of necessity at issue was
that of logical necessity as captured in a logical syllogism. Syllogisms are
logical arguments of a particular form in which a predicate is either affirmed
or denied of a subject via some intermediate proposition. For example,

1.  Socrates is human
2.  All humans are mortal
3.  $\therefore$ Socrates is mortal

Here the predicate \<mortal\> is predicated of Socrates via the intermediate
proposition \<All humans are mortal\>. The chaining together of predicates make
evident how Socrates’s mortality is grounded in his humanity—i.e. in his being a
human being. So we explain a particular feature of Socrates by saying that he is
a being of a particular kind—a human being.

Now, in scientific knowledge we have an understanding of the conclusion
as being *caused* by the relevant subject matter of the premises. It
might seem that, in the case of Socrates’s mortality above, there is no
such cause present. However, this is not how the Aristotelian conceives
of things. In the above syllogism, the relevant cause or explanation is
Socrates’s humanity. In Aristotelian terms, it is the nature of being
human to be mortal, and it is the fact that Socrates is human—a member
of the *species* human—that determines, causes, and thus explains, his
being mortal. Another way of putting this is that it is a fact about
Socrates’s *essence*—his being human—that explains why he is mortal.

‘*Essence*’, for Aristotle, picked out that feature or features of a thing that
explain why it is the thing that it is. Essences thus determine (i) kind
membership for any individual (e.g. that Socrates is of the kind \<human\>) and
(ii) explain why the particular individual has the manifest properties that it
does. It is this sort of explanation that is manifest in deductive syllogisms
like the one concerning Socrates above.

The ultimate aim of a science is to provide knowledge from the reason or ground
of a thing, so as to explain why it is the way that it is. This requires appeal
to simple real definitions as opposed to compound nominal definitions. Compound
definitions denote pseudo-individuals or kinds in the sense that they name items
of different categories, most standardly substances and accidents. Hence
“musician” is a compound definition denoting a kind of thing—a musical
person—which does not have a genuine essence of its own. Musicians are not the
kind of thing which are taken to have a common essence which explains why all
things of that kind are the way they are (in contrast, say, to “human” or
“animal”). No individual goes out of existence by ceasing to be musical (not
even a musician, for there are, unfortunately, tone-deaf musicians) while a
(human) musician clearly goes out of existence by ceasing to be human.

Nominal definitions, in contrast, do allow for distinguishing genuine (as
opposed to pseudo) individuals, but do so in a way that fails either to identify
the principle attribute of the thing or effect a proper division of its genus.
To use an example from Locke (E III.x.17), we consider *rational animal* a
better definition of a human being than *two legged animal with broad nails*
because the latter, though (let us say) extensionally correct, fails either to
capture the principle characteristic of being human (rationality) or effect a
proper division of its genus (animal).[^1]

So, according to the Aristotelian conception of science, scientific inquiry aims
at providing knowledge of why something is the way it is, which in turn requires
the articulation of a real definition. Real definitions characterize the
essences of individuals in a given domain of inquiry. The individuals in this
domain are thus fundamental (in the sense of being explanatorily primary).
Aristotle’s name for such a fundamental individual is “substance” [*ousia*].
Given real definitions of substances an inquirer could use general principles,
in which the real definitions figure, to provide a priori deductive
demonstrations of the non-accidental (i.e. necessary but non-essential) features
of any possible object in the relevant domain. Hence the possibility of
scientific knowledge depends on the possibility of providing real definitions of
things—substances—which thereby constitute the most explanatorily basic entities
in the relevant domain of inquiry.

## Locke on the Extent of Human Knowledge

Locke distinguishes our epistemic attitudes (what he calls ‘Assent’) into three
categories—Knowledge, Belief, and Opinion. As we have seen, there are three
sorts of knowledge—intuitive, demonstrative, and sensitive. When it comes to
existing things Locke thinks our knowledge is very limited, concerning only what
is present to one's current consciousness.

Our knowledge of real existing things is thus quite restricted. What about
scientific knowledge [*scientia*] of the kind articulated by Aristotle?
Possession of such knowledge isn’t directly of existing things, since we might
have knowledge of the essences of things that don’t actually exist. A good
example of this would be the objects of Euclidean geometry. The Euclidean
definitions of the plane figures articulate the conditions for the existence of
those figures (e.g. for anything to be a triangle, its angles must sum to 180˚),
whether or not they actually do exist. Unsurprisingly then, Locke does think
that we have scientific knowledge of geometry (IV.ii.10).

Locke also thinks that we have scientific knowledge of morality.

> Where there is no Property, there is no Injustice, is a Proposition as
> certain as any Demonstration in Euclid: For the Idea of Property,
> being a right to any thing; and the Idea to which the Name Injustice
> is given, being the Invasion or Violation of that right; it is
> evident, that on the strength of these two Ideas and the Names annexed
> to them I can as certainly know this Proposition to be true, as that a
> Triangle has three Angles equal to two right ones. (IV.iii.18).

So morality is characterized by determinate relationships between ideas, that we
can know demonstratively, and thus is a body of scientific knowledge as sure any
bit of mathematics.

Can we have scientific knowledge of the natural world? Put another way, is
natural philosophy a form of *scientia*? Answering this question positively
would be to say that we could have knowledge of the essences of material
substances, and thus of the necessary connections between the essences and the
other features of the substances whose essences they are (IV.vi.11). Locke’s
radical position (here in stark contrast to Descartes’s) is that we *cannot*
have such knowledge, and thus that natural philosophy is not a form of
*scientia*. Locke gives two reasons for thinking this.

The first argument he provides is a kind of argument from access. The worry he
raises is that our access to mind-independent objects is largely via knowledge
of their secondary qualities.

> The ideas that our complex ones of substances are made up of, and about which
> our knowledge concerning substances is most employed, are those of their
> secondary qualities; which depending all (as has been shown) upon the primary
> qualities of their minute and insensible parts; or, if not upon them, upon
> something yet more remote from our comprehension; it is impossible we should
> know which have a necessary union or inconsistency one with another. For, not
> knowing the root they spring from, not knowing what size, figure, and texture
> of parts they are, on which depend, and from which result those qualities
> which make our complex idea of [for example] gold, it is impossible we should
> know what other qualities result from, or are incompatible with, the same
> constitution of the insensible parts of gold; and so consequently must always
> co-exist with that complex idea we have of it, or else are inconsistent with
> it. (IV.iii.11)

Our knowledge of primary qualities is greatly limited, Locke thinks. We may have
knowledge that all the parts of a body must have the determinable properties of
shape, size, motion, and solidity, but by and large we do not know the
*determinates* of these properties, so we do not know which determinate
qualities go with which others, nor how they combine to produce the wide variety
of secondary qualities characteristic of the macroscopic world.

This connection between the primary and secondary qualities is something
that Locke seems to think is totally inscrutable to us (IV.iii.12-13).
According to Locke there is simply “no discoverable connection” between
the determinate primary qualities of a body and its secondary qualities.

> We are so far from knowing what figure, size, or motion of parts produce a
> yellow colour, a sweet taste, or a sharp sound, that we can by no means
> conceive how any size, figure, or motion of any particles, can possibly
> produce in us the idea of any colour, taste, or sound whatsoever: there is no
> conceivable connexion between the one and the other. (IV.iii.13)

Locke then sums up his argument as follows:

> In vain, therefore, shall we endeavour to discover by our ideas (the only true
> way of certain and universal knowledge) what other ideas are to be found
> constantly joined with that of our complex idea of any substance: since we
> [1] neither know the real constitution of the minute parts on which their
> qualities do depend; nor, [2] did we know them, could we discover any necessary
> connexion between them and any of the secondary qualities: which is
> necessary to be done before we can certainly know their necessary
> co-existence. So, that, let our complex idea of any species of substances be
> what it will, we can hardly, from the simple ideas contained in it, certainly
> determine the necessary co-existence of any other quality whatsoever. Our
> knowledge in all these inquiries reaches very little further than our
> experience. (IV.iii.14)

Thus we cannot have scientific knowledge in natural philosophy because (1) we
cannot know the real essences of the minute bodies composing the observable
world, and (2) even if we could know them we could not discern the necessary
connections that exist between those bodies and their observable secondary
qualities. We might summarize these points by saying that our grasp of the
determinate primary qualities of things is at best obscure, while the connection
between these determinate primary qualities and either determinate or
determinable secondary qualities is completely inscrutable.

Locke does acknowledge that we have very limited knowledge of the
necessary connections that exist between some of the primary qualities
of things.

> Some few of the primary Qualities have a necessary dependence, and
> visible connexion one with another, as Figure necessarily presupposes
> Extension, receiving or communicating Motion by impulse, supposes
> Solidity. (IV.iii.14)

But knowledge of such connections is very limited, based partly on the fact that
our knowledge of determinate primary qualities of corpuscles is limited by their
unobservability (in fact if not in principle, see [@downing1992]), and in part
by the possibility that the physical world is causally interconnected in ways
such that our ignorance of extremely remote objects (e.g. astronomically remote
planets, etc.) would entail our ignorance of aspects of bodies closer to us
(cf. IV.vi.11-12)

<!-- NOTE: 2 obstacles to knowledge: the obscurity of determinate primary qualities of corpuscles and the inscrutability of the connection between determinate primary qualities and determinate/determinable secondary qualities  -->

## Is Locke a Skeptic?

If Locke denies that we can have proper scientific knowledge of the
natural world, does this make him a skeptic?

Recall that Locke argues for a kind of knowledge, inferior to intuitive and
demonstrative knowledge, but nevertheless worthy of the name—viz., ‘sensitive’
knowledge. Sense experience gives us knowledge of the existence of currently
perceived objects via their perceived properties. This does not give us any
knowledge of the real essences of things but only what Locke calls their
‘nominal’ essence—that set of characteristics which we use to sort things into
kinds (e.g. \<dog\>, \<gold\>). Our knowledge of the coexistence of such
properties as to make it count as a thing of a certain kind (e.g. as a dog or a
piece of gold) is limited to probable rather than certain connections.

> For all the Qualities that are co-existent in any Subject, without
> this dependence and evident connexion of their Ideas one with another,
> we cannot know certainly any two to co-exist any farther, than
> Experience, by our Senses, informs us. Thus though we see the yellow
> Colour, and upon trial find the Weight, Malleableness, Fusibility, and
> Fixedness, that are united in a piece of Gold; yet because no one of
> these Ideas has any evident dependence, or necessary connexion with
> the other, we cannot certainly know, that where any four of these are,
> the fifth will be there also, how highly probable soever it may be.
> (IV.iii.14)

For sensitive knowledge to count as knowledge proper of the natural world, it
must satisfy two conditions. First, the complex idea which we generate via an
act of combination on a set of simple ideas must concern simple ideas which we
have actually encountered as coexisting in nature.

> Herein therefore is founded the reality of our Knowledge concerning
> Substances, that all our complex Ideas of them must be such, and such
> only, as are made up of such simple ones, as have been discovered to
> co-exist in Nature. And our Ideas being thus true, though not,
> perhaps, very exact Copies, are yet the Subjects of real (as far as we
> have any) Knowledge of them. (IV.iv.12)

This condition keeps our sensitive knowledge from being arbitrary or otherwise
potentially ungrounded in the nature of how things are outside the mind. Locke’s
worry here is that the fundamental principle governing the combination of
ideas—viz., logical contradiction—is insufficient to give us knowledge of how
qualities might actually combine in the world. A logically coherent combination
of ideas might signify a really incoherent or incompatible combination of
qualities.

Second, Locke argues that we can form 'nominal' essences, and thus have general
knowledge of the physical world (e.g. that all gold is malleable), insofar as we
keep to combinations that accord with experienced regularities. Locke bases this
on the grounds that ”whatever have once had an union in Nature, may be united
again.“ (IV.iv.12) Locke thus advocates a view according to which our knowledge
of the external world, including even its very basic nature, is always subject
to revision.
