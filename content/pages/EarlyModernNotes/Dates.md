Title: Important Dates & People

The late medieval and early modern eras with which we're concerned are bookended
by the births and deaths of specific people, and are often categorized as
falling into particular distinct 'periods.' These include the birth and death of
particular figures, as well as the span of distinctive social or cultural
movements. For example, the following people and dates are often considered
important. 

- [Aristotle](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle/) (384-322 BC)
- [Augustine](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/) (354–430)
- [Thomas Aquinas](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/) (1225–1274)
- The Renaissance:  ca. 1348 -- ca. 1648
- The 'Scientific Revolution':  ca. 1500 -- 1700
- The Reformation: 1517 (95 Theses) -- 1648 (Peace of Westphalia ending 30 Years' War)
- [René Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/) (1596-1650)
- [Immanuel Kant](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/) (1724–1804)

# The Scientific Revolution

The philosophical systems which we study in eary modern philosophy take place
against a backdrop of radical changes in our understanding of the natural world
and the place of humankind in it. Accordingly, this era is often termed the
'[scientific revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_revolution).'
Some important people and dates include:

* First printed edition of Euclid's *Elements* in 1482.
* [Nicolaus Copernicus](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/)
  (1473–1543) published *On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres* in 1543,
  which advanced the heliocentric theory of cosmology.
* [Andreas Vesalius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius) (1514–1564)
  published *On the Structure of the Human Body* (1543), which discredited
  Galen's views. He found that the circulation of blood resolved from pumping of
  the heart. He also assembled the first human skeleton from cutting open
  cadavers.
* [Franciscus Vieta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius) (1540–1603)
  published *Introduction to the Art of Analysis* (1591), which gave the first
  symbolic notation of parameters vs. unknown quantities in literal algebra.
* [William Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer))
  (1544–1603) published *On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies*, and *On the Great
  Magnet the Earth* in 1600, which laid the foundations of a theory of magnetism
  and electricity.
* [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe) (1546–1601) made
  extensive and accurate observations of the planets in the late
  16th century, which became the basic data for Kepler's studies. Brahe was one
  of the last astronomers to work without a telescope, using only the naked eye.
* [Sir Francis Bacon](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/francis-bacon/)
  (1561–1626) published the *New Organon* in 1620, which outlined a new system
  of logic based on the process of induction, which he offered as an improvement
  over Aristotle's philosophical process of syllogism. This contributed to the
  development of what became known as the
  [scientific method](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/).
* [Galileo Galilei](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/galileo/) (1564–1642) was
  a scientific genius who, among other things, improved the telescope, with
  which he made several important astronomical discoveries, including the four
  largest moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, and the rings of Saturn, and
  made detailed observations of sunspots. He developed the laws for falling
  bodies based on pioneering quantitative experiments which he analyzed
  mathematically. His work was famously condemned by the Catholic church. He
  died under house arrest.
* [Johannes Kepler](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kepler/) (1571–1630)
  published the first two of his three laws of planetary motion in 1609.
* [William Harvey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey) (1578–1657)
  demonstrated that blood circulates, using dissections and other experimental
  techniques.
* [René Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/) (1596–1650)
  published his *Discourse on the Method* in 1637, which helped to establish the
  scientific method.
* [Antonie van Leeuwenhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonie_van_Leeuwenhoek)
  (1632–1723) constructed powerful single lens microscopes and made extensive
  observations that he published around 1660, opening up the micro-world of
  biology.
* [Isaac Newton](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton/) (1643–1727) built
  upon the work of Kepler and Galileo. He showed that an inverse square law for
  gravity explained the elliptical orbits of the planets, and advanced the law
  of universal gravitation. His development of infinitesimal calculus opened up
  new applications of the methods of mathematics to science. Newton taught that
  scientific theory should be coupled with rigorous experimentation, rather than
  metaphysical speculation, which became one of central principles of modern science.
