The third *Meditation* contains an important proof of God, but also provides
discussion of various metaphysical principles, how we can be certain of the
truth of our ides, and a significant discussion of the nature of ideas.

# Ideas

Descartes's
[theory of ideas](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/) is central
to both his epistemology and his metaphysics. In the third *Meditation*,
Descartes uses his theory of ideas to both explain aspects of our cognition of
ourselves and the external world, and to provide proof of the existence of God.

## Objective & Formal Reality

Descartes distinguishes three different 'levels' or degrees of being. The most
fundamental level of being is that of being a
*[substance](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/substance/)*. Substances and
their powers are the fundamental units of explanation in Descartes's
metaphysics. Descartes distinguishes two kinds of substance, material and
mental. Substance is defined by its principle *attribute*, which characterizes
the fundamental feature of a substance. In the case of material substance, this
attribute is *extension*, in the case of mental substance, thought. 
According to Descartes substance is what is "fundamental" or what fundamentally
exists. This is built into the very notion of substance for Descartes. He says,

> By substance we can understand nothing other than a thing which exists in such
> a way as to depend on no other thing for its existence. And there is only one
> substance which can be understood to depend on no other thing whatsoever,
> namely God. (*Principles* I.51; AT 8A:24)

God, as infinite substance, exists totally independently of anything else.
Finite substances such as ourselves, or any material being, exist independently
from other substances, but not of God. In this way Descartes thinks of substance
as fundamental, but also as bifurcated between infinite (God) and created finite
substances. 

At the third and most derivative level of being we have *modes*, which are ways
in which something (i.e. a substance) may be. So, for example, *shape* is a mode
of extension (it is a way in which something may be extended), and extension is
the principle or essential attribute of material substance. Ideas are modes of
thought, which is the principle attribute of mental substance.

Near the beginning of the *Third Meditation*, Descartes distinguishes ideas from
other modes of thought.

>First, however, considerations of order appear to dictate that I now classify
>my thoughts into definite kinds, and ask which of them can properly be said to
>be the bearers of truth and falsity. Some of my thoughts are as it were the
>images of things, and it is only in these cases that the term 'idea' is
>strictly appropriate — for example, when I think of a man, or a chimera, or the
>sky, or an angel, or God. Other thoughts have various additional forms: thus
>when I will, or am afraid, or affirm, or deny, there is always a particular
>thing which I take as the object of my thought, but my thought includes
>something more than the likeness of that thing. Some thoughts in this category
>are called volitions or emotions, while others are called judgments. (7:36–7;
>EMT M.10)

Emotions, judgment, ideas, and acts of will are all modes of the mind. But ideas
are distinguished from these other mental modes in virtue of being "as it were
the images of things." As we saw in the Wax Argument from the last meditation,
Descartes does not think that all our ideas are *sensory* images of things. We
can have purely intellectual ideas of objects, as Descartes argues we do in the
case of the wax. But our sensory and intellectual ideas share a common feature,
which makes them both *ideas*---viz., they present an object to the mind, either
by resembling them (as is perhaps the case with sensory ideas), or by some other
means. As he says in reply to both Hobbes and Gassendi, an idea is what is
immediately present to or perceived by the mind (7:366, 393).

Descartes introduces two ways of considering an idea. The first is the idea
merely as a mode of the mind. In this sense the '*formal reality*' of the idea
is that of a mental mode. But an idea may also be considered in virtue of what
it makes present to the mind---what it, as it were, is an image of---this is
to consider the '*objective reality*' of the idea (7:40-1)

Reality, according to Descartes, comes in degrees or levels. We've seen this
already in our discussion of substance and mode above. The highest level of
reality is that of an infinite substance. The only such substance is God. So the
highest level of reality is ascribed to God. The next highest level of reality
is that of finite or created substance as defined by its principle attribute (i.e.
mental or material) . Finally, at the lowest level of reality, we have modes
or characteristics of substances other than (or derived from) their principle
attribute. Each degree of reality is dependent on the prior. So modes depend on
the attributes of substances, and finite substance depends on the creative
activity of infinite substance. This is true not only of the formal reality of
things but also the objective reality of our ideas of things.

## Vivacity, Clarity, & the Truth Rule

One of the interpretations we considered in the *Second Meditation* was that
Descartes aimed, in the *Cogito*, to extract a particular method for gaining
knowledge. He suggests something along these lines at the beginning of the
*Third Meditation*.

>I am certain that I am a thinking thing. Do I not therefore also know what is
>required for my being certain about anything? In this first item of knowledge
>there is simply a clear and distinct perception of what I am asserting; this
>would not be enough to make me certain of the truth of the matter if it could
>ever turn out that something which I perceived with such clarity and vivacity
>was false. So I now seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule that
>whatever I perceive very clearly and vividly is true. (7:35)

As Hatfield indicates, there is a fairly straightforward argument being made
here (@hatfield2003, 144).

1. I know with certainty that I am a thinking thing.
2. This knowledge is based solely on a clear and distinct perception of its
truth.
3. Clear and distinct perception would not be sufficient to yield such knowledge
if it were in any way fallible.
4. $\therefore$ Clear and distinct perception provides a sufficient ground for
knowledge; whatever I so perceive is true.

The argument is valid. It's conclusion provides us with a general rule for
acquiring knowledge. This principle is often called the 'truth rule'. The
question is whether any sense can be made of the second premise, that the
knowledge gained via the *Cogito* is due entirely to the clarity and vivacity of
the relevant ideas. Is there a way to recognize clear and vivid ideas and to
distinguish them from all other kinds of idea?

We'll postpone until the *Fifth Meditation* the issue of whether there is a form
of vicious circularity inherent in Descartes's argument.

## Ideas and Internalism about Content

Descartes's notion of an idea suggests that our ideas could be just as they are
and yet nothing beyond one's mind could exist. In Descartes's terms, the
objective reality of one's ideas (setting to the side issues concerning ideas of
God) is something we can consider independently of the question as to whether
anything exists which corresponds to those ideas. This notion of
[mental content](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/) is
sometime called a '[narrow](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/)'
or 'inernalist' conception of mental content, in contrast to a 'wide' or
'[externalist](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-externalism/)'
conception of content.

Descartes's skeptical arguments and their relation to his theory of ideas
inaugurated a view of mental content that remains influential today. Is mental
representation something that may be considered wholly independently from the
subject's environment? Or is mental representation ineluctably tied up with a
subject's environs so that the former cannot be intelligibly discussed
independently of the latter?

# Proof of God's Existence

After giving his brief argument for the truth rule, Descartes goes on to talk of
the sources of our ideas and the possibility that there is a deceitful God. Why
is the issue of God and His characteristics important? Descartes worries that so
long as he may reasonably consider the possibility of a deceitful God, he cannot
be sure of the truth of claims that otherwise seem obviously true, such as
simple mathematical claims.

>what about when I was considering something simple and straightforward in
>arithmetic or geometry, for example that two and three added together make
>five, and so on? Did I not see at least these things clearly enough to affirm
>their truth? Indeed, the only reason for my later judgment that they were open
>to doubt was that it occurred to me that perhaps some God could have given me a
>nature such that I was deceived even in matters which seemed most evident. And
>whenever my preconceived belief in the supreme power of God comes to mind, I
>cannot but admit that it would be easy for him, if he so desired, to bring it
>about that I go wrong even in those matters which I think I see utterly clearly
>with my mind’s eye. (7:36)

Here the 'preconceived belief' of an all powerful God threatens to derail the
Meditator's confidence in even the clearest of mathematical ideas. Descartes
goes on to exclaim that when he put the issue of God out of his mind and just
considers clear and vivid ideas, as in the *Cogito* reasoning or in mathematics,
then he cannot be anything other than certain of their truth.

So in order that he may rid himself of (the admittedly slight) doubt about the
certainty of such fundamental truths, Descartes explains that

>any reason for doubt which depends simply on this supposition
>[that God is either deceitful or does not exist] is a very slight and, so to
>speak, metaphysical one. But in order to remove even this slight reason for
>doubt, as soon as the opportunity arises I must, examine whether there is a
>God, and, if there is, whether he can be a deceiver. For if I do not know this,
>It seems that I can never be quite certain about anything else. (7:36)

Descartes articulates two proofs in this *Meditation* for the existence of God.
The first depends on the nature of the Meditator's idea of God. The second
depends on the the claimed dependence of finite beings on the creative powers of
an infinite God.

## The Sources of Our Ideas

>Among my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and others
>to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing is, what truth
>is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But my
>hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes
>from things which are located outside me, or so I have hitherto judged. Lastly,
>sirens, hippogriffs and the like are my own invention. (7:37–8)

Descartes distinguishes three sources for our ideas. Ideas may be 'innate',
'adventitious', or 'invented'. Innate ideas are those which are had by the
subject simply in virtue of having a mind. Adventitious ideas are those which
seem to come unbidden from sources external to the subject. Invented ideas are
fictions, generated by (in some sense) voluntary acts of imagination. 

Descartes notes that in the case of adventitious ideas, one is inclined to take
them to resemble their causes. But, Descartes also notes, there is no reason to
believe that this is true. He cites three reasons for so believing, and seeks to
undermine them. First, he notes that we simply have "a spontaneous impulse to
believe" that it is true (7:38). But this he dismisses this as a reason because
natural impulse is fallible (7:39). Second, he notes that such ideas simply come
into the mind, and often quite involuntarily (e.g. opening one's eyes in a lit
room results in a lot of involuntary visual sensory ideas). But this involuntary
character is no reason, he thinks, to believe that such ideas resemble anything
objective, or that they even arise from anything beyond the subject. For
example, dreams are involuntary in their 'feel' but they are wholly subjective.
He then denies that such ideas must resemble their sources even if they do come
from something beyond the subject.

>finally, even if these ideas did come from things other than myself, it would
>not follow that they must resemble those things. Indeed, I think I have often
>discovered a great disparity (between an object and its idea> in many cases.
>For example, there are two different ideas of the sun which I find within me.
>One of them, which is acquired as it were from the senses and which is a prime
>example Of an idea which I reckon to come from an external source, makes the
>sun appear very smal1. The other idea is based on astronomical reasoning, that
>is, it is derived from certain notions which are innate in me (or else it is
>constructed by me in some other way), and this idea shows the sun to be several
>times larger than the earth. Obviously both these ideas cannot resemble the sun
>which exists outside me; and reason persuades me that the idea which seems to
>have emanated most directly from the sun itself has in fact no resemblance to
>it at all (7:39).

Hence, though we can distinguish different possible sources of our ideas, at
this point the Meditator has no reason to think that any of her ideas come from
anything other than herself, nor that they in any way resemble or otherwise
reveal how things are without her mind, in the objective world.

## Objective Reality & the Causal Principle

>it is manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as much
>[reality] in the efficient and total cause as in the effect of that cause. For
>where, I ask, could the effect get its reality from, if not from the cause? And
>how could the cause give it to the effect unless it possessed it? It follows
>from this both that something cannot arise from nothing, and also that what is
>more perfect - that is, contains in itself more reality - cannot arise from
>what is less perfect. And this is transparently true not only in the case of
>effects which possess [what the philosophers call] actual or formal reality,
>but also in the case of ideas, where one. is considering only [what they call]
>objective reality (7:40-1).

Something cannot come from nothing. This is a truth which the Meditator suggests
is "obvious by the natural light". This was a principle commonly accepted in
Descartes's time, and still remain a reasonable one. When put in terms of
Descartes's views on the hierarchy of reality, something with a lesser degree of
reality cannot be the cause of something with a greater degree; the reality of
the (efficient and total) cause must be equal to or exceed the effect. When
applied to the objective content of an idea, it means that there must be a cause
of the content of an idea whose reality is at least as great as the reality of
that which is 'depicted' by the idea. So, for example, when one has an idea as
of a horse (a finite substance) then it must have been caused by something that
has at least the reality of a finite substance. This doesn't mean that it has to
have been caused by an actual horse. But, according to the principle, it cannot
be the case that an idea whose objective content is that of a finite substance
could be caused by a mere mode.

## The First Proof -- God and the Objective Reality of our Ideas

Descartes then straightforwardly applies this principle to the idea of God. This
raises an immediate problem, for the idea of God is the idea of "a substance
that is infinite, independent, supremely intelligent, supremely powerful, and
which created both myself and everything else (if anything else there be) that
exists" (7:45). According to the causal principle, a finite substance
cannot have an idea whose objective content is greater the reality of its cause.
This means that neither the Meditator, nor any other finite substance (or their
modes) could be the cause of the Meditator's idea of God. In fact there is only
one possible being who could be the cause of the Meditator's idea---viz., God.
Hence, given that the Meditator has such an idea, God must exist.

More schematically, we can put the argument this way:

1. The objective reality of an idea must have a cause equal to it or greater
2. The objective reality of my idea of God is that of an omni-omni-omni substance
3. No finite being has sufficient reality to cause the content (i.e. the
   objective reality) of my idea of God
4. $\therefore$ The cause of the objective reality of the idea must be God

### Two Objections

1. Is the idea of God innate -- i.e. is the idea of God "in" everyone? 
    - Descartes seems to think, not that everyone has the idea of God in that
      everyone is thinking of God all the time, but rather that any being
      capable of reasoning will come, eventually, on the idea of a creator who
      is good, knowledgeable, and benevolent. 
2. Assuming that we *do* all have an idea of God, is that idea one of an
   omni-omni-omni being?
    - *The priority of the infinite*: According to Descartes, we must have an
      idea of God as an infinite being because our ideas of finite things
      presuppose an idea of infinity. He says, "my perception of the infinite,
      that is God, is in some way prior to my perception of the finite, that is
      myself" (7:45)
        + Descartes illustrates this by means of the claim that an awareness of
          a lack or absence (e.g. a hole) presupposes an awareness of perfection
          or presence (e.g. the doughnut which has the hole). Another relevant
          example might be one involving awareness of a spatial boundary.
          Awareness of the boundary presupposes an awareness of the space
          extending beyond the boundary. This may be iterated, such that
          awareness of any particular space seems to presuppose an awareness of
          an infinitely extended space of which this local space is merely a
          limitation (As we will see Kant makes much of this argument in his later discussion
          of space).
3. Does the idea of God really require an infinite cause?
    - Why couldn't the idea of an infinite substance simply be constructed from
      the idea of a finite substance, whose limits are then abstracted away to
      generate the idea of God?
        + Here again, Descartes argues that we cannot *generate* the idea of god
          via a construction out of finite materials, since the finite presumes
          a grasp of the infinite. Descartes thus appeals again to the the
          priority of the infinite in our grasp of the finite. 
    - Nevertheless, one might object that at best, Descartes's argument yields
      only the conclusion that an infinite substance must be the cause of our
      idea of God. But why think that this infinite substance is God rather than
      something else?
        + It is not clear that Descartes, at least at this point in the
          *Meditations* has a reply to this objection. It may be that he gives
          such a reply only in his proof for God's existence as offered in the
          *Fifth Meditation*. However, he does make several references here to
          God's 'perfection', which might suggest that the issue isn't simply
          one of infinite power, but of infinite perfection, and that any being
          possessing such perfection must be God.

## The Second Proof -- God's preservation of finite beings

The Meditator then asks “whether I myself, who have this idea [of God], could
exist if no [more perfect] being existed” (7:48). He then offers a proof
by process of elimination. Four causes of his existence are considered, viz.,
self-causation, his parents, another less perfect being, and finally, God.
Descartes rules out the first since any being that could create itself from
nothing would be God.

Descartes then rules out the other options by appeal to a '*preservation*'
principle. He says,

>a lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of
>the others, so that it does not follow from the fact that I existed a little
>while ago that I must exist now, unless there is some cause which as it were
>creates me afresh at this moment -- that is, which preserves me. For it is quite
>clear to anyone who attentively considers the nature of time that the same power
>and action are needed to preserve anything at each individual moment of its
>duration as would be required to create that thing anew if it were not yet in
>existence. Hence the distinction between preservation and creation is only a
>conceptual one, and this is one of the things that are evident by the natural
>light (7:49)

Descartes makes several points here. The first claim is that a substance is
*temporally extended* in the sense that its existence can be divided into
discrete moments, each of which is independent of the others. The second point
is Descartes's claim about preservation being equivalent to creation. He
endorses the following principle.

Preservation Principle:
: the same power or action is needed to preserve a substance from moment to
moment as is needed to create that substance at a moment

Since the Meditator is at least a finite thinking substance, something is needed
to sustain the Meditator's existence as a finite being. This cannot come from
the Meditator's parents or any other finite substance, since such beings would
lack the power necessary to preserve the Meditator's existence from moment to
moment. So it must come from an infinite substance -- God. More schematically,
the argument looks like this:

1.  Any substance that exists exists at discrete moments that are
    independent of each other
2.  The existence of a substance at one moment does not give it the
    power to exist at any other subsequent moment
3.  Existence at a moment requires an act equivalent to creation
    (preservation = creation)
4.  No finite entity can create itself
5.  ∴ no finite entity can preserve itself from one moment to the next
6. At least some finite substance exists from one moment to the next
7.  ∴ there must be some entity capable of creation & preservation---God

The argument appears sound, but that isn't to say that it is unobjectionable.
Obviously, one of the most controversial claims here is that there is no
fundamental difference between preservation and creation. Further controversial
assumptions include the claim that time may be divided into discrete and
independent moments in the manner that Descartes suggests, and that a substance
which exists at a moment needs something other than itself to continue to exist
at the next moment.
