Here I focus primarily on the 'Real Distinction' argument and the argument for
the existence of an external world.

# The 'Real Distinction' Argument #

In the *Sixth Meditation* Descartes famously distinguishes the mind from the
body, arguing that not only are we aware of ourselves fundamentally as
thinking things, but that thinking things (mental substance) are in principle
independent of any material body.

The argument appears as the first step in a larger argument aimed at proving the
existence of material bodies even in the face of the kinds of doubt raised in
previous *Meditations*.

## Three Kind of Distinction ##

Descartes distinguishes between three kinds of distinction, *real*, *modal*, and
*conceptual* (*Principles*, §§60-2; 8A:28-31). Let's take these in reverse
order.

### Conceptual Distinctness ###

Descartes defines a *conceptual distinction* as,

> a distinction between a substance and some attribute of that substance without
> which the substance is unintelligible; alternatively, it is a distinction
> between two such attributes of a single substance. Such a distinction is
> recognized by our inability to form a clear and distinct idea of the substance
> if we exclude from it the attribute in question, or, alternatively, by our
> inability to perceive clearly the idea of one of the two attributes if we
> separate it from the other. (8A:30)

This distinction depends on facts about what is *intelligible* or otherwise
required for the understanding to form a clear and distinct idea of something.
But it is not yet a claim about *what kind of things exist*. That is, it is not
yet a claim concerning the existence of real metaphysical connections between
conceptually distinguishable things. Hence, though there is a conceptual
distinction between a substance and its attributes, the fact of such a
distinction does not show that we have two metaphysically distinct
entities---viz., a substance, on the one hand, and its attributes, on the other.
A conceptual distinction is thus ultimately a distinction in the way we think of
thinks, it is not a distinction that carves at a natural joint in reality.

### Modal Distinctness ###

In the *Principles* Descartes explains further that a *modal distinction*,

> can be taken in two ways: firstly, as a distinction between a mode, properly
> so called, and the substance of which it is a mode; and secondly, as a
> distinction between two modes of the same substance. The first kind of modal
> distinction can be recognized from the fact that we can clearly perceive a
> substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot,
> conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance...The second kind of
> modal distinction is recognized from the fact that we are able to arrive at
> knowledge of one mode apart from another, and vice versa, whereas we cannot
> know either mode apart from the substance in which they both inhere. For
> example, if a stone is in motion and is square-shaped, I can understand the
> square shape without the motion and, conversely, the motion without the square
> shape; but I can understand neither the motion nor the shape apart from the
> substance of the stone. (8A:29-30)

The notion of a modal distinction is thus closely related to that of a
conceptual distinction. Descartes had in fact lumped the two together in his
replies to the *First set of Objections* to the *Meditations*, concerning the
wax argument. Here we have the claim that we can (i) distinguish (or make
intelligible) a mode of a substance from substance itself; and (ii) one mode
from another. Once again though, we cannot draw any conclusion from the
existence of a modal distinction to any conclusion concerning reality. Hence,
from the fact that I may modally distinguish shape from motion, I cannot
conclude that one can really exist without the other.

### Real Distinctness ###

Descartes defines a real distinction as follows. 

> Strictly speaking, a *real* distinction exists only between two or more
> substances; and we can perceive that two substances are really distinct simply
> from the fact that we can clearly and distinctly understand one apart from the
> other. (8A:29)

Here Descartes claims that, in the case of real distinctness, we can conclude
something about how things are in reality on the basis of our pure and distinct
ideas. In other words, insofar as one can distinctly and clearly distinguish two
substances from one another (either numerically or qualitatively), those things
*really are distinct* from one another.

## The Real Distinction Argument (7:78) ##

Descartes puts the argument as follows (I've separated it into three parts: A,
B, and, C).

> [A] I know that everything which I clearly and distinctly understand is
> capable of being created by God so as to correspond exactly with my
> understanding of it. Hence the fact that I can clearly and distinctly
> understand one thing apart from another is enough to make me certain that the
> two things are distinct, since they are capable of being separated, at least
> by God. The question of what kind of power is required to bring about such a
> separation does not affect the judgement that the two things are distinct. [B]
> Thus, simply by knowing that I exist and seeing at the same time that
> absolutely nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a
> thinking thing, I can infer correctly that my essence consists solely in the
> fact that I am a thinking thing. It is true that I may have (or, to
> anticipate, that I certainly have) a body that is very closely joined to me.
> [C] But nevertheless, on the one hand I have a clear and distinct idea of
> myself, in so far as I am simply a thinking, non-extended thing; and on the
> other hand I have a distinct idea of body, in so far as this is simply an
> extended, non-thinking thing. And accordingly, it is certain that I am really
> distinct from my body, and can exist without it. (7:78)

We should read this text as trying to prove three distinct claims (see @hatfield2003, 250).

1. *Complete Being~T~*: a thinking thing can exist as a substance whose sole
   essence is thought.
2. *Complete Being~B~*: body can exist as a substance whose sole essence is extension. 
3. *Mutual Exclusion*: mental substance has no bodily modes, and bodily
   substance has no mental modes.

Why all three? One might think that all that is necessary for distinctness is
showing (1) and (2). However, proving the first two claims leaves open the
possibility that there may be some mental beings which could not exist or
operate without a body and vice versa. Descartes wishes to exclude this as a
possibility, if for no other reason than it was a view broadly held by his
Aristotelian opponents, so showing (3) is required as well as (1) and (2).

We can raise several basic questions about the argument. For example, what role
does God's power to separate mind from body play in [A]? Is [B] the argument or do
we only get the full argument in [C]? Or is [C] really just an elaboration of
[B]? Let's take the three parts in turn.

### God's Power ###

Part [A] says:

> [A] I know that everything which I clearly and distinctly understand is
> capable of being created by God so as to correspond exactly with my
> understanding of it. Hence the fact that I can clearly and distinctly
> understand one thing apart from another is enough to make me certain that the
> two things are distinct, since they are capable of being separated, at least
> by God. The question of what kind of power is required to bring about such a
> separation does not affect the judgement that the two things are distinct. 

Here is what part A [seems to be arguing](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-modal/#ReaDis):

1. I clearly and distinctly understand mind apart from body and body apart from
   mind.
2. God can bring about whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive.
3. God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from mind.
4. If God can bring about that mind is apart from body and body is apart from
   mind, then mind and body can exist apart.
5. $\therefore$ Mind and body can exist apart.

How convincing is the argument? Perhaps the most important worry in the
argument, given the context in which Descartes was arguing, comes from the
appeal to God. Even assuming such a being exists, the worry is that God could
(let's assume) *miraculously* bring it about that a mind (or mental substance)
exists apart from any body. But since an all-powerful God (especially as
Descartes conceives of it) can do anything, this conclusion comes as no
surprise. What Descartes wants is a stronger conclusion---viz., that it is in
the *nature* of mental and material substance to be able to exist apart from one
another. In other words, mind and body can exist apart not just given a
miraculous act of God, but rather by their very natures.

To the extent, then, that the argument relies on appeal to God, it does so only
to remind the reader that God stands behind our distinct and clear ideas,
validating their connection to reality.

So what does passage [A] do? It tells us two important things (cf. @hatfield2003,
252). First, that clear and distinct ideas are a guide to what is really
metaphysically possible (this will be severely disputed by Locke and Kant, among
others). Second, it gives us a specific basis or *criterion* for real
distinctness---viz., the conceivability of a thing's independent existence (cf.
the discussion in the *Principles* above).

### Knowing One's Essence  ###

> [B] Thus, simply by knowing that I exist and seeing at the same time that
> absolutely nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a
> thinking thing, I can infer correctly that my essence consists solely in the
> fact that I am a thinking thing. It is true that I may have (or, to
> anticipate, that I certainly have) a body that is very closely joined to me.

[B] reports two findings. First, that the Meditator exists. Second, that nothing
else belongs to one (as *Meditator*) than thinking---thinking constitutes one's
*essence*. Does it follow from one's existence as a thinking thing that one is
*solely* a thinking thing and not having either bodily features or being itself
a process of some corporal body? Not without further assumptions. However,
Descartes does hold that the essence of a substance is articulated by its
'principle attribute' and that all modes of a substance depend upon and must be
conceived in terms of this principle attribute. Hence, if the essence of oneself
is thought, then one's principle attribute is thought (or thinking), and thus,
all modes of oneself would have to be (strictly speaking) conceivable solely in
terms of modifications of thought.

This connection between attribute and modes, along with the assumption that
clear and distinct ideas are an accurate guide to reality (or what's really
metaphysically possible) would yield the conclusion that a purely mental
substance could exist independently of any physical/corporeal characteristics.
But perhaps Descartes either felt the need to make the argument independently of
any assumption regarding the connection between mode and essence, or he wanted
to make explicit the point regarding our clear and distinct idea of the real
distinctness of mind and body; in any case he goes on to do just this.

### The Real Distinctness of Mind and Body ###

> [C] But nevertheless, on the one hand I have a clear and distinct idea of
> myself, in so far as I am simply a thinking, non-extended thing; and on the
> other hand I have a distinct idea of body, in so far as this is simply an
> extended, non-thinking thing. And accordingly, it is certain that I am really
> distinct from my body, and can exist without it. 

According to the Meditator's distinct and clear ideas:

i.   The self is a thinking and non-extended thing
ii.  Corporeal substance is extended and non-thinking

This gives us *Mutual Exclusion* --- claim (3) above. But we need the "Complete Being" theses to be shown as well---viz., that a thinking thing can exist as a substance whose sole essence is thought and a body can exist as a substance whose sole essence is extension. But passage [B] provided the claim that each of us knows ourself as a being whose sole essence is thought. So we get *Complete Being~T~*. Perhaps Descartes thought it was permissible to simply assume *Complete Being~B~*. If so then we get all three of our needed claims for meeting Descartes's goal of showing that the mind is really distinct from the body. 

Gary Hatfield sums up his discussion of the argument this way:

> Putting the three passages together, [A] provides the criterion for a real
> distinction between substances (capability of existing apart); it also offers
> clear and distinct perception as the method for determining whether the
> criterion is met. [B] affirms that a thinking thing can exist on its own. [C]
> affirms that this thinking thing has no properties peculiar to bodies. But if
> it can exist as a thing that has no bodily properties, it can exist apart from
> bodies. Which, by the criterion in [A], means that mind is a substance really
> distinct from body. (@hatfield2003, 254-5)

### An Objection: Excluding Ignorance ###

We asked, above, how it was that the Meditator could know that thought is not
identical with features or processes of a material body. Versions of this
objection were pressed forcefully by Caterus (in the *First Set of Objections*)
and by Arnauld (in the *Fourth Set*). How do we know that the apparent
distinctness of mind and body is not due to our ignorance of their real
identity? Arnauld puts the issue in terms of someone ignorant of the Pythagorean
theorem trying to reason about the essential features of triangles.

> Suppose someone knows for certain that the angle in a semi-circle is a right
> angle, and hence that the triangle formed by this angle and the diameter of
> the circle is right-angled. In spite of this, he may doubt, or not yet have
> grasped for certain, that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the squares
> on the other two sides; indeed he may even deny this if he is misled by some
> fallacy. But now, if he uses the same argument as that proposed by our
> illustrious author, he may appear to have confirmation of his false belief, as
> follows: 'I clearly and distinctly perceive', he may say, 'that the triangle
> is right-angled; but I doubt that the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the
> squares on the other two sides; therefore it does not belong to the essence of
> the triangle that the square on its hypotenuse is equal to the squares on the
> other sides.' (7:201-2)

In other words, one might have a clear and distinct idea of a triangle without
understanding the Pythagorean theorem, but this doesn't mean that the properties
specified by the theorem, specifically that the square of the hypotenuse (the
side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other
two sides, are not in fact essential properties of the triangle. Descartes thus
needs to explain why his Real Distinction argument doesn't generate the same
problem.

Descartes's answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, refers to what the Meditator has
learned so far in the course of her meditations. Specifically, he appeals to (i)
the fact that the Meditator has clear and distinct ideas of mind and body, where
each excludes the features of other; (ii) the nature of clear and distinct ideas
is such that they adequately represent how reality is (or what is really
possible). So Descartes simply denies Arnauld's premise, that the subject has a
clear and distinct idea of a right triangle. If they really did have such an
idea, Descartes argues, they would know that the Pythagorean theorem is true of
such triangles.

Hence, to reject Descartes's argument we must reject either (i) the claim that
we (or the Meditator) have clear and distinct ideas of the mind as distinct from
the body, or (ii) that clear and distinct perception is a reliable guide to real
possibility/actuality.

# A Proof of the External World (7:79) #

After concluding that the Meditator is distinct from her body, Descartes goes on
to argue that neither imagination nor sensation are essential to the self,
conceived purely as a thinking thing (7:78-9). But this then raises the
question of how and why the Meditating subject comes to have such sensory
perceptions. We'll take each part of the argument (7:79) in turn. 

> Now there is in me a passive faculty of sensory perception, that is, a faculty
> for receiving and recognizing the ideas of sensible objects; but I could not
> make use of it unless there was also an active faculty, either in me or in
> something else, which produced or brought about these ideas. But this faculty
> cannot be in me, since clearly it presupposes no intellectual act on my part,
> I and the ideas in question are produced without my cooperation and often even
> against my will. So the only alternative is that it is in another substance
> distinct from me -- a substance which contains either formally or eminently
> all the reality which exists objectively in the ideas produced by this
> faculty (as I have just noted). 

Assuming that the sensory faculty is passive (this was a common Aristotelian
assumption), Descartes argues that we need some explanation of origin of our
sensory ides. It cannot come from the subject herself because the ideas arise
involuntarily (this assumption might be questioned since, for example, the
content of our dreams is not voluntary but comes from 'within' us). So there
must be some external cause of our sensory ideas, which itself respects the
causal principle (as discussed in *Meditation 3*).

There are three possible sources for our ideas of material things. Either they
come from (a) bodies themselves, or they come from (b) a 'higher' non-material
being (like an angel/demon) or from God.

> This substance is either (a) a body, that is, a corporeal nature, in which
> case it will contain formally <and in fact> everything which is to be found
> objectively <or representatively> in the ideas; or else it is (b) God, or some
> creature more noble than a body, in which case it will contain eminently
> whatever is to be found in the ideas.

Descartes then gives his argument for rejecting (b):

> But since God is not a deceiver, it is quite clear that he does not transmit
> the ideas to me either directly from himself, or indirectly, via some creature
> which contains the objective reality of the ideas not formally but only
> eminently. For God has given me no faculty at all for recognizing any such
> source for these ideas; on the contrary, he has given me a great propensity to
> believe that they are produced by corporeal things. So I do not see how God
> could be understood to be anything but a deceiver if the ideas were
> transmitted from a source other than corporeal things. It follows that
> corporeal things exist.

Descartes's argument here seems to be that since we are naturally strongly
inclined to assent to beliefs that the causes of our sensory ideas are the
material bodies which those ideas purport to reveal, any other causal origin of
such ideas would amount to a deceitful act on the part of God. One might object
here, as Gassendi does, that it isn't at all clear why we should assume that
when a body acts as a cause on the mind, that our ideas should reveal it
accurately because "an efficient cause is something external to the effect and
often of a quite different nature” (7:288). We thus need some reason to think
that sensory ideas really do tell us truths about our environment, if we are
supposed to find it plausible that any causal origin other than that of material
bodies would be deceitful. In response to this kind of worry Descartes says,

> They [bodies] may not all exist in a way that exactly corresponds with my
> sensory grasp of them, for in many cases the grasp of the senses is very
> obscure and confused. But at least they possess all the properties which I
> clearly and distinctly understand, that is, all those which, viewed in general
> terms, are comprised within the subject-matter of pure mathematics. (7:80)

So our sensory ideas may not all correspond, resemble, or otherwise reveal how
things truly are in our environment (e.g. as to their colors, tastes, and
sounds) but they do at least reveal to us the specific determinations of objects
that reflect their geometrical (and intellectually known) essences. The argument
thus looks something like this:

1. We have sensory ideas, which purport to be of external material things
2. The function of our sensory faculty is to reveal information about our
   environment
3. Our sensory faculty is passive, so our sensory ideas must come from somewhere
   external to us
4. Sensory ideas come from either (a) bodies or (b) 'higher' non-material beings
   (angels, God) [causal principle]
5. If our sensory ideas of bodies were not caused by bodies then God would be a
   deceiver [from 1, 2, 4]
6. God is no deceiver
7. $\therefore$ There exist material bodies that are the causes of our ideas

We thus need premise (2) in order to secure the claim that God would be
deceitful if our sensory ideas were not caused by bodies. Otherwise one could
object that it might not be deceitful of God to furnish our minds with sensory
ideas, so long as they are not the kind of thing which is supposed to tell us
about the external world.

## The Role of the Senses vs. the Intellect ##

Perception of clear and distinct ideas via the intellect (or understanding)
provides us with knowledge of the essences of things---extension and its modes
in the case of bodies---thought and its modes in the case of thinking beings.
According to Descartes the senses have an altogether different role. They do
reveal some of the actual properties of bodies, such as size and shape, but
Descartes argues that their main function is not to reveal truths about the
natures of objects in our environments, but rather to serve us practically to
inform us of objects to seek or avoid in the promotion of our bodily well-being.

> My nature, then, in this limited sense, does indeed teach me to avoid what
> induces a feeling of pain and to seek out what induces feelings of pleasure,
> and so on. But it docs not appear to teach us to draw any conclusions from
> these sensory perceptions about things located outside us without waiting
> until the intellect has examined the matter. For knowledge of the truth
> about such things seems to belong to the mind alone, not to the combination of
> mind and body, Hence, although a star has no greater effect on my eye
> than the flame of a small light, that does not mean that there is any real or
> positive inclination in me to believe that the star is no bigger than the
> light; I have simply made this judgement from childhood onwards without any
> rational basis. (7:82-3)

So sensory ideas (i) inform us about our environment, which is necessary for the
success of Descartes's proof of the external world and; (ii) are primarily for
distinguishing bodily goods from bads, not for telling us what things in our
environment really are. We then need to be careful about making judgments based
on our sensory reports of our environment.[^202629] As Descartes puts it,

[^202629]: For extensive further discussion of this point see [@simmons1999], [-@simmons2003].

> In these cases and many others I see that I have been in the habit of misusing
> the order of nature. For the proper purpose of the sensory perceptions given
> me by nature is simply to inform the mind of what is beneficial or harmful for
> the composite of which the mind is a part; and to this extent they are
> sufficiently clear and distinct. But I misuse them by treating them as
> reliable touchstones for immediate judgements about the essential nature of
> the bodies located outside us; yet this is an area where they provide only
> very obscure information. (7:83)
