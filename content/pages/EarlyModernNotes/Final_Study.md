- Locke on knowledge and science
    + what different kinds of knowledge are there for Locke?
    + what is scientific knowledge according to Locke?
        * does Locke think that we have scientific knowledge of the natural world? 
            - why not?
                + obscurity and inscrutability of knowledge of real essence of matter
- Leibniz's Idealism
    + two arguments against matter
