# Matter & Mechanism

The view of the material world for which Descartes and Locke both argue
was incredibly influential, both for the growth of natural science, and
for the conception of the human being as a member of the natural world.
[G.W.F. Leibniz](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/), while
sympathetic to aspects of the mechanical system, particularly its
attempt to offer explanations in natural philosophy based on a small set
of resources (the features of material body) and appeal to a limited set
of laws (the laws of motion), nevertheless was [extremely
critical](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz-physics/) of both
materialism and those aspects of mechanistic explanation realiant upon
it. Here we’ll look at the central features of the theory of matter
which Leibniz criticizes, as well as basic elements of his positive
theory.

Mechanism is the explanatory thesis that the natural world in all its diversity
can be explained solely by a small set of features of bodies (size, shape,
motion, and solidity) plus laws of nature governing their interaction. This
explanatory claim often went along with another claim concerning the nature of
body—viz., that body should be understood as a *substance* existing
independently of mind, and either understood as constitutive of minds (if one
were inclined to Materialism), or as a kind of substance distinct from and
intelligible independently of mind or mental substance (as a dualist would
claim).

A question that immediately arises concerning material substance is whether it
is infinitely divisible or only divisible to some finite degree or
level. The notion of ‘divisible’ that is relevant here is not one
concerned with divisibility *in practice* — i.e. whether someone could
actually infinitely divide a chunk of matter, but rather divisibility
*in principle* — i.e. whether the nature of matter itself admits of
infinite or only finite divisibility. We’ll see that Leibniz denies that
either a finitist or an infinitist answer is metaphysically
satisfactory, and uses this as a motivation for constructing his
idealist metaphysics.

# Leibniz Against Matter

Leibniz articulated a variety of criticisms concerning the prevailing notion of
matter amongst the scientifically minded intelligentsia of the seventeenth
century. We’ll look at two criticisms—first, his criticism of Descartes’s claim
that material bodies are independent substances, and second his criticism of the
ultimate reality of matter.

## Matter is not a Substance

Recall that in Descartes’s metaphysical system, the world consisted of two kinds
of thing, material substance and mental substance. As substances, material
bodies and minds are supposed to individual, subsistant, things that depend on
nothing else for their existence (nothing, except God, at any rate).

> As for •corporeal substance and mind (i.e. created •thinking
> substance), they can be understood in terms of a single common
> concept, namely this one: things that don’t depend for their existence
> on anything except God. (*Principles* 1.52)

Thus, for Descartes a material substance and a mind are both individual
and independent kinds of thing.

Leibniz insists not only on the independence requirement that Descartes
articulates, but also that there must be *unity* to an individual
substance such that there is some account of its status as *one* (as
opposed to many) thing. Leibniz emphasizes this point clearly in the
*New System*:

> after much reflection, I perceived that it is impossible to find the
> principles of a true unity in matter alone, or in what is only passive, since
> everything in it is only a collection or aggregation of parts to infinity.
> Now, a multitude can derive its reality only from true unities, which have
> some other origin and are considerably different from [[mathematical]] points
> [[which are only the extremities and modifications of extension,]] which all
> agree cannot make up the continuum. Therefore, in order to find these real
> entities I was forced to have recourse to a formal atom, since a material
> thing cannot be both material and, at the same time, perfectly indivisible,
> that is, endowed with a true unity. (p. 139)

Leibniz argues here that the ‘true unity’ required to attribute to matter the
status of substance (as thus as recognizing individual material bodies as
substances) cannot be found in matter itself. Essential to Leibniz’s argument
here is his distinction between a mere collection and a genuine unity. Later in
the *New System* Leibniz claims that a mere collection or aggregate could never
be a unity.

> Such a unity could not occur in the machines made by a craftsman or in a
> simple mass of matter, however organized it may be; such a mass can only be
> considered as an army or a herd, or a pond full of fish, or like a watch
> composed of springs and wheels. Yet if there were no true substantial unities,
> there would be nothing substantial or real in the collection (142)

Leibniz’s point is that however organized an army or flock of birds may be,
neither the army nor the flock is anything above and beyond its parts—it is
merely an *aggregate*. Since there is nothing to an aggregate individual beyond
its parts—in Leibniz’s terms, there is no principle of unity for the aggregate
(though perhaps Leibniz would change his mind if he knew about the
[murmurations of starlings](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/02/the-murmurations-of-starlings/100690/))—there
is no sense in which the whole aggregate is *independent* in the way required
for it to be a substance.

The obvious move here is to say that some material bodies are unities—viz.,
*atoms*. Leibniz anticipates this with his claim that “what is material can’t at
the same time be perfectly indivisible.” But this isn’t, of itself, a convincing
argument that Leibniz offers since it is simply the denial of the atomist’s
thesis that some material bodies are indivisible. The atomist claims that there
is a ‘ground floor’ of materiality, where there are material
bodies—atoms—without any parts. Leibniz, however, does provide something in the
way of an argument against this.

> if there were no true substantial unities, there would be nothing substantial
> or real in the collection. That was what forced Cordemoy to abandon Descartes

> (142)

Leibniz claims several things here. First, he argues that the notion of
a material atom is ‘contrary to reason.’ Why would that be? One of
Leibniz’s fundamental intellectual commitments is to what he calls the
‘[Principle of Sufficient
Reason](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/)’ (PSR).
PRS states that everything that exists must have an intelligible ground
for its existence. Put another way, every fact must have an explanation.

The claim that atoms of matter are contrary to reason, then, is the claim that
their existence would violate the PSR. Leibniz’s idea here is that the existence
of an material atom would mean the existence of an extended being which was not
divisible. But Leibniz thinks that it is simply a contradiction to claim that an
extended being is not divisible. This is because extended beings are extended in
space, and just as it is always mathematically possible to divide the space
which an object occupies into further spaces so too should it be possible to
divide the object itself into further parts, each of which is an occupant of
this space. This was particularly true of those, like
[Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-physics/#3), who thought
of material extension as *identical* with spatial extension (i.e. that there was
no distinction between matter and the space that it occupies). To argue, as the
atomist does, that some material bodies are indivisible, is to assert that there
is arbitrary stopping point in the cycle of division, an arbitrariness that goes
against the PSR.

Leibniz seems to be aware that this appeal to the PSR may not be fully
convincing and so provides a second argument.

> [atoms] are still composed of parts, since the invincible attachment of one
> part to another (if we can reasonably conceive or assume this) would not
> eliminate diversity of those parts. (142)

Here his argument again appeals to the claim that things extended in space are
going to have parts, presumably corresponding to the different parts of space
that they occupy. Leibniz argues that the indivisibility of an atom (assuming,
for the sake of argument, that it is indivisible) is not enough to show that it
lacks parts. If the atomist admits the existence of such parts then Leibniz can
appeal to his independence argument. Things with parts are dependent on their
parts and thus are not independent in the way required of substance. They are,
in Leibniz’s terms, ‘accidental’ rather than ‘real’ unities.

## Matter is not Ultimately Real

If Leibniz’s arguments against the substantive status of matter are
successful then they show that matter is not to be understood as an
ultimate, and independent, entity. But Leibniz does not stop with this
point. He further argues that the very reality of matter should be
called into question.

Let’s look again at the aggregate passage:

> Such a unity could not occur in the machines made by a craftsman or in a
> simple mass of matter, however organized it may be; such a mass can only be
> considered as an army or a herd, or a pond full of fish, or like a watch
> composed of springs and wheels. Yet if there were no true substantial unities,
> there would be nothing substantial or real in the collection (142)

So matter, even understood as an aggregate, would not be real if there were not
substantial unities which grounded it. Leibniz thinks that this substantial
entity must be a non-material entity—a ‘metaphysical point’, or what he would
later call a ‘monad’. Leibniz argues that the reality of matter requires the
existence of ‘true unities’, but matter is not the kind of thing that could
itself be a ‘true unity’ so there must be something else—a ‘real and living
point’—whose existence grounds and explains the existence of matter. How does
Leibniz’s argument work?

1.  Matter (material body) is nothing but a collection or aggregate of
    parts
2.  Any real aggregate must ultimately be composed of parts which are
    not themselves aggregates—viz., ‘true unities’
3.  True unities cannot be material (b/c they must be indivisible) or
    mathematical (b/c mathematical points are not real)
4.  ∴  The reality of matter depends on a non-material true unity

Would the atomist or ‘corpuscularian’ agree with this argument? Both
would agree with the first premise, that material bodies are collections
of parts. But why should we endorse premises (2) and (3)? Leibniz does
nothing to motivate these premises beyond the kind of analogical
arguments surrounding the unreality of aggregates like flocks of birds
or piles of stones—aggregates are nothing more than the sum of their
parts.

In the background of Leibniz’s argument is something we might call the
‘Principle of Borrowed Reality’ (PBR). Leibniz makes this point quite clearly in
a letter to the Jesuit priest and philosopher
[Antoine Arnauld](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arnauld/):

> I believe that where there are only beings by aggregation, there aren't any
> real beings. For every being by aggregation presupposes beings endowed with
> real unity, because every being derives its reality only from the reality of
> those beings of which it is composed, so that it will not have any reality at
> all if each being of which it is composed is itself a being by aggregation, a
> being for which we must still seek further grounds for its reality, grounds
> which can never be found in this way, if we must always continue to seek for
> them. (To Arnauld (April 30, 1687), p. 85)

Is the PBR plausible? There is certainly something intuitive about it. A
building is only as real as the materials that constitute it. A painting
is only as real as the flecks of paint that make it up. What’s more, it
seems that the corpuscularian is at a disadvantage here because they too
would seem to want to endorse the principle, as it is part of the
explanatory power of corpuscularianism (or any hierarchical metaphysical
theory) that the macroscopic world is built out of, and ultimately
depends upon, the features of the microscopic world and interactions
between such microscopic entities.

So, just as the finitist or atomist response to the issue of division is
unsatisfactory because of its arbitraryness (and thus its violation of
the PSR), the infinitist answer to the issue of division violates the PBR.
Thus, according to Leibniz, we cannot countenance matter as substantial
or real. Leibniz’s positive views on the status of matter seem to change
over the course of his life. At the point of writing the *New System*
(1695) Leibniz considered matter to be real but not ultimately so, its
existence and unity being dependent on the existence of substantial
forms or souls.

> Only metaphysical points or points of substance (constituted by forms or
> souls) are exact and real, and without them there would be nothing real, since
> without true unities there would be no multitude. (142)

By the time he writes the *Monadology* (1714) Leibniz has given up on
the reality of matter altogether, arguing that it is only a perception
existing in the mind of the perceiver. He states this clearly in a 1712
letter to Bartholomew des Bosses, Jesuit teacher of theology and a
professor of mathematics at Cologne.

> I consider the explanation of all phenomena solely through the
> perceptions of monads functioning in harmony with each other, with
> corporeal substances rejected, to be useful for a fundamental
> investigation of things…It is true that things which happen in the
> soul must agree with those which happen outside of it. But for this it
> is enough for the things taking place in one soul to correspond with
> each other as well as with those happening in any other soul, and it
> is not necessary to assume anything outside of all souls or monads.
> According to this hypothesis, we mean nothing else when we say that
> Socrates is sitting down than that what we understand by ‘Socrates’
> and by ‘sitting down’ is appearing to us and to others who are
> concerned. (Letter to des Bosses, 16 June, 1712)

This position, subsequently called ‘*phenomenalism*’, construes the
material world as nothing more than the orderly perceptual appearances
of an underlying non-material order of mind-like substances or ‘monads’.
