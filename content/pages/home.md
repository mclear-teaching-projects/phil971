This is the homepage for PHIL 232 -- History of Early Modern Philosophy

This course offers an introductory survey of some of the key figures in early
modern (17th—18th century) European philosophy. These may include: Descartes, Locke,
Leibniz, Newton, and Hume. Our main focus will be on the enormously
influential theories of René Descartes, specifically his theories of mind and
nature, as well as subsequent reactions, criticisms, and (partial) defenses of
his views in the writings of other prominent philosophers. Major themes include
the nature of mind and matter, the structure of scientific explanation,
causation and necessity, free will, and the existence and nature of God.
