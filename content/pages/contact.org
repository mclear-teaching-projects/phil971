Email is the best way to reach me. I answer emails on weekdays, usually
within 24 hrs.

Students, please check your [[file:{filename}/extra/syllabus.html][syllabus]] or the assignments [[http://phil971.colinmclear.net/assignments][online]] before emailing
your question. If it is covered in the syllabus, I likely won't respond. Please
remember to include an informative subject line that summarizes the content of
your email (e.g. “Question about Assignment 3 for PHIL101″ instead of
“Question”).
