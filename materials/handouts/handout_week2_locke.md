# Locke's Content Empiricism

- All representational content derives from two sources---viz. outer sense or
  "sensation" and inner sense or "reflection"\footnote[][-1.75in]{All ideas come
  from sensation or reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say,
  white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:—How comes it to be
  furnished? ... To this I answer, in one word, from experience. In that all
  our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our
  observation employed either, about external sensible objects, or about the
  internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves, is
  that which supplies our understandings with all the materials of thinking.
  These two are the fountains of knowledge, from whence all the ideas we have,
  or can naturally have, do spring. (Locke 1970, I.i.2)}
  
Sensation:
:  ideas of objects, gained via ways in which those objects affect
   us\footnote[][]{our Senses, conversant about particular sensible objects,
   do convey into the mind several distinct perceptions of things, according
   to those various ways wherein those objects do affect them. ... This great
   source of most of the ideas we have, depending wholly upon our senses, and
   derived by them to the understanding, I call \emph{sensation}. (ECHU
   II.i.3)}

Reflection:
:  ideas of the mind's operations, gained via attention to the mind's activity
   in generating sensation (sensory ideas)\footnote[][]{the other fountain
   from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,—the
   perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed
   about the ideas it has got;—which operations, when the soul comes to
   reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of
   ideas, which could not be had from things without. ... This source of ideas
   every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having
   nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might
   properly enough be called internal sense. (ECHU II.i.4)}\footnote[][]{By
   reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be
   understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations,
   and the manner of them, by reason whereof there come to be ideas of these
   operations in the understanding. (ECHU II.i.4)}

- What makes these two sources of ideas belong to a single faculty of sense?
    - Ideas are received passively
    - Ideas do not reveal their object as it is in itself
    - Ideas have a (distinctive?) phenomenology 
    - Ideas rely on attention to something (e.g. an (impression caused by an)
      external object or an operation of the mind)

# Locke on Knowledge

- Knowledge is the perception of agreement/disagreement between one's
  ideas\footnote[][]{Since the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath
  no other immediate object but its own ideas, which it alone does or can
  contemplate, it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about
  them...Knowledge then seems to me to be nothing but the perception of the
  connexion of and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of our
  ideas. In this alone it consists. (ECHU IV.i.1-2)}
  
- Four types of agreement/disagreement for knowledge (ECHU IV.i.3)
    1. Identity and diversity
    2. Relations
    3. Co-existence/necessary-connection
    4. Real existence
    
- Three kinds or "degrees" of knowledge (ECHU IV.ii)
    1. Intuitive
    2. Demonstrative
    3. Sensitive
  
- **Q**: If knowledge requires perception of relations between ideas, then how
    can we have knowledge of particular ideas?\footnote[][]{Every one ﬁnds in
    himself, that he knows the Ideas he has; That he knows also, when any one
    is in his Understanding, and what it is; And that when more than one are
    there he knows them distinctly and unconfusedly one from another. Which
    always being so, (it being impossible but that he should perceive what he
    perceives,) he can never be in doubt when any Idea is in his Mind, that it
    is there, and is that Idea it is; and that two distinct Ideas, when they
    are in his Mind, are there, and are not one and the same Idea. (IV.vii.4;
    cf. IV.i.4)}
        1. Knowledge that an idea is in the mind
        2. Knowledge of what the idea is
        3. Knowledge of the difference between ideas
        
## Weinberg's Proposal

\newthought{Consciousness \& Reflection}:

- Locke's commitments (or desiderata on a theory):
    1.  All thinking is conscious
    2.  Consciousness is a "perception of a perception"
    3.  Consciousness cannot be a source of ideas (over and above sensation & reflection)
    4.  Whatever consciousness is must be reconcilable with the "obscure
        notions" of II.i.25 and the "floating visions" of II.i.8
    5.  Consciousness has a role in memory, sensitive knowledge, the cogito,
        personal identity, and (implicitly) in moral agency
- **Reflexivity**: Weinberg proposes that we satisfy all these claims by
  construing consciousness as "a reﬂexive self-referential awareness internal
  to ordinary perception" [@weinberg2016a-ch2, 32]. Consciousness is not
  something *added* to perception of an idea, but is rather something
  "*internal*" to it (p. 33)
- **Mineness**: Weinberg also construes consciousness as that by which we
  grasp our ideas or thoughts more generally as our own\footnote[][-3in]{The
  consciousness that we are perceiving ideas allows us to ﬁnd ourselves in any
  present or past thought or action. That we are the ones thinking and acting
  is given implicitly in the consciousness constituent of every perception of
  an idea. As Locke says, “consciousness” is that “whereby I am my self to my
  self ” (II.xxvii.24). It is the experience or awareness of my thoughts and
  actions as mine—my awareness of myself as thinking and acting—that
  constitutes the criterion by which I can claim to be having those thoughts
  and engaging in those actions. This implicit grasp of ourselves as so
  perceiving a thought or performing an action is made explicit to us when we
  turn our present attention to those thoughts and actions in reﬂection.
  (Weinberg 2016, 50)}
  
      - **Objection**: Does the proposed self-reflexive content of perception
        of an idea violate Locke's content empiricism?

\newthought{Self-Consciousness \& Knowledge}:

- Knowledge is propositional
- Knowledge requires perception of an idea(s)
- Every perception of ideas brings with it the idea of
  existence\footnote[][-1.75in]{Existence and Unity, are two other Ideas, that are
  suggested to the Understanding, by every Object without, and every Idea
  within. When Ideas are in our Minds, we consider them as being actually
  there, as well as we consider things to be actually without us; which is,
  that they exist, or have Existence. (ECHU II.vii.7)}
- Perception of an idea is a complex mental state consisting of, at least, (i)
  the act of perception, (ii) the idea perceived, and (iii) the
  self-consciousness that *I am perceiving*
- Knowledge of particular ideas consists of (i) the act of perception; (ii)
  the particular idea perceived; (iii) the idea of existence; (iv) the
  consciousness that *I am perceiving*\footnote[][-1.75in]{We...have three different
  constituents of the perception of any idea: the idea perceived, an idea of
  existence, and the consciousness that I am perceiving them...the
  simultaneity of the idea perceived and the idea of existence grounds the
  knowledge that the idea is there. But also constituent in the complex mental
  state, and so simultaneous with the idea perceived and the idea of
  existence, is consciousness, which is an awareness of an I perceiving. The
  simultaneity of the idea perceived and consciousness grounds the knowledge
  of what the idea is. That is, the thing presented to me as existing in my
  mind agrees with what I am perceiving it to be. (Weinberg 2016, 77)}
- Knowledge of an idea is made possible by perceiving the intuitive agreement
  amongst the parts of the *perception* of the idea\footnote[][]{My suggestion
  is that the trio of items in the mind leads to one true mental proposition
  expressing the agreements therein. ... Knowing our own ideas, then, is due
  to perceiving a complexity of mental content, each part of which makes a
  contribution to the state of affairs as equally expressed in any of the
  family of the relevant true propositions. (Weinberg 2016, 78)}

## Self-Knowledge & the Cogito ##

- According to Locke we have intuitive knowledge of our own
  existence\footnote[][]{As for our own Existence, we perceive it so plainly,
  and so certainly, that it neither needs, nor is capable of any proof. For
  nothing can be more evident to us, than our own Existence. I think, I
  reason, I feel Pleasure and Pain; Can any of these be more evident to me,
  than my own Existence? . . . Experience then convinces us, that we have an
  intuitive Knowledge of our own Existence, and an internal infallible
  Perception that we are. In every Act of Sensation, Reasoning, or Thinking,
  we are conscious to our selves of our own Being; and, in this Matter, come
  not short of the highest degree of Certainty. (ECHU IV.ix.3)}
  
      1. Knowledge that one exists is just as certain as knowledge of one's ideas
      2. Knowledge that one exists is had in virtue of any act of thinking 
      3. Knowledge of one's existence requires nothing further than what is
         present to mind (i.e. the idea one currently perceives)

# Leibniz's Criticisms

## Is Reflection Empirical?

- Locke characterizes reflection as a form of *experience*, an "inner" kind of
  perception. But is one's awareness of one's mind something that is really
  "given" to us, as the senses provide information of external
  objects?\footnote[][]{Now, reflection is nothing other than attention
  to what is within us, and the senses do not give us what we already bring
  with us...can anyone deny that there is a great deal innate in our mind,
  since we are innate to ourselves, so to speak, and since we have within
  ourselves being, unity, substance...and a thousand other objects of our
  intellectual ideas? (Leibniz 1996, 294, Preface to the \emph{New Essays})}

## Reflection's Reach 

- Locke construes reflection as providing only an awareness of the mind's
  *operations* but why not think we have access to ourselves as
  subjects?\footnote[][]{It is very true that our perceptions of ideas come
  either from the external senses or from the internal sense, which one may
  call reflection; but this reflection does not limit itself solely to the
  operations of the spirit, as is said [in Locke’s ECHU II.1.4]; it extends to
  the spirit itself, and it is in apperceiving it that we apperceive
  substance. (Leibniz, \emph{Echantillon de reflexions sur le II. livre [of
  Locke's \emph{Essay}], 1698})}

## Reflection & Regress

- Locke considers reflection to be consciousness of our own thoughts (or
  mental operations) and considers consciousness to accompany all thought. But
  this generates a vicious regress.\footnote[][]{It is impossible that we
  should always reﬂect explicitly on all our thoughts; for if we did, the mind
  would reﬂect on each reﬂection, ad inﬁnitum, without ever being able to move
  on to a new thought. For example, in being aware of [‘en m’appercevant de’]
  some present feeling, I should have always to think that I think about that
  feeling, and further to think that I think of thinking about it, and so on
  ad inﬁnitum. It must be that I stop reﬂecting on all these reﬂections, and
  that eventually some thought is allowed to occur without being thought
  about; otherwise I would dwell for ever on the same thing (Leibniz 1996,
  118)}
