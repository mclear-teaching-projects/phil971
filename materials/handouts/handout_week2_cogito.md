# Descartes & the *Cogito* Argument

## The 'Cogito' Argument[^104553] ##

[^104553]: I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in
  the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow
  that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I
  certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and
  cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case
  I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me
  as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so
  long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything
  very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, *I am,
  I exist*, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or
  conceived in my mind. (7:25)

1. What exactly is the conclusion of the argument?
    - weak: the meditator exists
    - strong: the meditator is a thinking thing 
2. How is the conclusion established?
    - inference?
    - intuition?
3. What role does the established conclusion play in Decartes's broader project?
    - foundation, system, or method?

\newthought{Objections:}

1. Does the *Cogito* argument beg the question?
    - Perhaps all Descartes is entitled to is the claim that *there is
      thinking going on*
2. Is the argument invalid?
    - Could we add or make explicit premises in the argument that would render
      it successful or is it hopeless?

\newthought{Reconstructing the argument}:

1. A thing is composed of its properties or characteristics /plus/ an
   underlying substance to which they belong
2. If there is a property or characteristic, then there must be a
   substance to which it belongs.
3. A thought is a property.
4. If there is a thought, then there is a substance to which it belongs.
5. There is a thought.
6. $\therefore$ There is a substance to which this thought belongs: "I".

- The reconstruction fails to account for the move from third- to first-person.

## The Nature of the 'I'[^11289] ##

[^11289]: what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing
    that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, is willing. is unwilling,
    and als0 imagines and has sensory perceptions. (7:28)
 
- What is it that unifies the kinds of features Descartes ascribes to
  the self?

## The Wax Argument ##

- We know substance purely intellectually[^104556]
    1. I can grasp that this melted wax is flexible and changeable so as to
       be capable of innumerable changes of shape.
    2. Imagination could allow me to grasp this fact only by representing
       these changes by an image of each possible shape.
    3. My imagination cannot represent the innumerable shapes required.
    4. It is not the imagination that allows me to grasp this capability of
       the wax.
    5. But I do grasp this capability, so it must be by a faculty other than
       (sense or) imagination: call it the "intellect".

[^104556]:   But what is meant here by “flexible” and “changeable”? Is it what I
  picture in my imagination: that this piece of wax is capable of
  changing from a round shape to a square shape, or from a square shape
  to a triangular shape? Not at all: for I can grasp that the wax is
  capable of countless changes of this kind, yet I am unable to run
  through this immeasurable number of changes in my imagination, from
  which it follows that it is not the faculty of imagination that gives
  me my grasp of the wax as flexible and changeable. (7:13)
  
- Is the self known better than any body?[^132155]

[^132155]: Surely my awareness of my own self is not merely much
  truer and more certain than my awareness of the wax, but also much
  more distinct and evident (7:33)



# Lessons from the Cogito
- Why is the *cogito* argument important for Descartes's project?[^1]
    - Provides knowledge that is *certain*
    - Provides knowledge of one's nature[^2]

## Why is certainty important?

1. Foundationalism: what is certain is a 'first principle' from which we
   derive other knowledge
2. Systematicity: what is certain is systematically connected with other knowledge
3. Methodology: what is certain reveal a method for deriving other (certain) knowledge
    
## Why is Self-Knowledge Important?

1. Establish the existence of a purely intellectual faculty for the
   acquisition of knowledge\footnote[][-1.15in]{I must therefore admit that the
   nature of this piece of wax is in no way revealed by my imagination, but is
   perceived by the mind alone. ... But what is this wax which is perceived by
   the mind alone? It is of course the same wax which I see, which I touch,
   which I picture in my imagination, in short the same wax which I thought it
   to be from the start. And yet, and here is the poim, the perception I have
   of it is a case not of vision or touch or imagination - nor has it ever
   been, despite previous appearances - but of purely mental scrutiny; and
   this can be imperfect and confused, as it was before, or clear and distinct
   as it is now, depending on how carefully I concentrate on what the wax
   consists in. (Descartes 1984, 21; AT 7:31)}
2. Establish the priority of the intellectual faculty over a sensible faculty
   for knowledge
3. Provide an account of the origin of central ideas/concepts necessary for
   metaphysical theorizing[^4]

[^1]: Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to
    shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to
    find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakeable.
    (AT 7:24)

[^2]: what then am I? A thing that thinks. What is that? A thing that doubts,
    understands, affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines
    and has sensory perceptions. ... Are not all these things just as true as
    the fact that I exist...The fact that it is I who am doubting and
    understanding and willing is so evident that I see no way of making it any
    clearer. [AT 7:28-9; @descartes1984, 19]

[^4]: Among my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and
    others to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing is,
    what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own
    nature. [@descartes1984, 26; AT 7:38]
