The fall 2017 course will examine views concerning introspection and self-knowledge as they appear in the work of Kant and the early German Idealists, particularly Fichte and Schelling. We will also look at how these views have been developed and modified in contemporary philosophy. Questions of interest include: What is self-knowledge? Is self-knowledge special? (e.g. is it especially epistemically secure?) How is self-knowledge gained? (e.g via sensory means?) Does self-knowledge require consciousness?
