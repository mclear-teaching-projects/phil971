<h1 id="meditation-one">Meditation&nbsp;One</h1>
<p>The title of the first <em>Meditation</em> is &#8220;what can be called into doubt&#8221;. Here Descartes lays out his method of doubt, calling on the reader to give up those beliefs which cannot be rendered absolutely certain. Descartes (or the Meditator) motivates the method by claiming it as necessary if one wanted &#8220;to establish anything in the sciences that was stable and likely to last&#8221; (<span class="caps">AT</span> <span class="caps">VII</span>:17)</p>
<h2 id="a-foundationalist-project">A Foundationalist&nbsp;Project</h2>
<p>A common way of understanding the structure of human knowledge, and one which Descartes seems to endorse, considers some bits of human knowledge as more basic than others, and considers the warrant for this more derivative knowledge as deriving from the more basic. The basic knowledge is not dependent on its being inferred from any other knowledge. This is what makes it basic. Call the position that all knowledge (or warrant) rests ultimately on a foundation of non-inferentially acquired knowledge (or warrant) <em><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/">foundationalism</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Meditator seems to endorse a foundationalist conception of human knowledge in the opening paragraphs of the <em>First Meditation</em>, and of pursuing a strategy of establishing a stable and lasting science on foundations which are immune to doubt. The Meditator also makes clear that he is interested primarily in theoretical knowledge rather than knowledge sufficient for guiding&nbsp;action.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know that no danger or error will result from my plan, and that I cannot possibly go too far in my distrustful attitude. This is because the task now in hand does not involve action but merely the acquisition of knowledge. (<span class="caps">AT</span> <span class="caps">VII</span>:22)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is clear that Descartes (or the Meditator) pursues a foundationalist epistemology in the <em>Meditations</em>, it is less clear how we should construe the nature of this foundation. There are two projects, apparently running side by side, and it is not always clear which Descartes pursues. On the one hand, we have a <em>normative</em> project of working our which beliefs we are <em>epistemically entitled</em> to hold. These are such beliefs, given the method of doubt, concerning which there is <em>no reason</em> to doubt. On the other hand, there is the wish to create a stable and lasting foundation for the sciences. In other words, a foundation which we are <em>psychologically unable</em> to doubt (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="smyth1986">@smyth1986</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="loeb1990">@loeb1990</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="bennett2001a">@bennett2001a</span>).</p>
<p>It may well be that these two projects are compatible. But it isn&#8217;t obvious that they converge. One may be unable to doubt what is nevertheless false, and one may be rather uncertain of what is in fact&nbsp;true.</p>
<h2 id="the-method-of-doubt">The Method of&nbsp;Doubt</h2>
<p>In order that he may arrive at a correct metaphysics Descartes argues that we must suspend judgment concerning any proposition whose truth is not known with absolute&nbsp;certainty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[To accomplish the goal of determining which of my judgments are absolutely certain] Reason now leads me to think that I should hold back my assent from opinions which are not completely certain and indubitable just as carefully as I do from those which are patently false. So, for the purpose of rejecting all my opinions, it will be enough if I find in each of them at least some reason for doubt. (<span class="caps">AT</span> <span class="caps">VII</span>:18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One might reasonably ask why this is necessary. Couldn&#8217;t we just hive off our metaphysical beliefs from our other beliefs until we figure out the correct metaphysical theory? Descartes suggests otherwise. He compares his method to one in which one sorts the bad apples out of an apple&nbsp;basket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose he had a basket full of apples and, being worried that some of the apples were rotten, wanted to take out the rotten ones to prevent the rot spreading. How would he proceed? Would he not begin by tipping the whole lot out of the basket? And would not the next step be to cast his eye over each apple in tum, and pick up and pour back in the basket only those he saw to be sound, leaving the others? In just the same way, those who have never philosophized correctly have various opinions in their minds which they have begun to store up since childhood, and which they therefore have reason to believe may in many cases be false. They then attempt to separate the false beliefs from the others, so as to prevent their contaminating the rest and making the whole lot uncertain. Now the best way they can accomplish this is to reject all their beliefs together in one go, as if they were all uncertain and false. They can then go over each belief in turn and re-adopt only those which they recognize to be true and indubitable. (<span class="caps">VII</span>:481)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the false beliefs &#8216;contaminate&#8217; and potentially render &#8216;the whole lot uncertain&#8217; Descartes argues the best strategy is to turn them all out in one go. Otherwise, he seems to think we run the risk of retaining false beliefs, which may be hidden among the good ones that they have&nbsp;&#8216;contaminated&#8217;.</p>
<h2 id="the-goal-of-doubt">The Goal of&nbsp;Doubt</h2>
<p>In the synopsis Descartes says concerning his method of doubt&nbsp;that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>its greatest benefit lies in freeing us from all our preconceived opinions, and providing the easiest route by which the mind may be led away from the senses. The eventual result of this doubt is to make it impossible for us to have any further doubts about what we subsequently discover to be true. (<span class="caps">VII</span>:12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the method of doubt is supposed to have a positive and salutary effect on the belief system of the doubter, bringing them around to what Descartes believes are the correct metaphysical beliefs, which cannot themselves be&nbsp;doubted.</p>
<p>This is important to notice, because it shows that Descartes is not interested in skepticism for its own sake, nor simply for its role in freeing the mind from prejudicial beliefs, but rather specifically for its capacity to orient the subject towards the correct metaphysical&nbsp;view.</p>
<p>One further question is whether the method of doubt is supposed to yield anything further than a proper basis for physics. In particular, several interpreters have argued that Descartes&#8217;s broader aim is a vindication of reason, either in the weak sense of investigating all grounds for doubt and finding them flawed, or in the strong sense of demonstrating that not only are there no grounds to <em>doubt</em> the capacity of reason to grasp truths about reality, but there is in fact a positive basis for believing that reason alone could provide knowledge of the nature or structure of reality (<span class="citation" data-cites="hatfield2003">@hatfield2003</span>, 94-5; cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="frankfurt2008">@frankfurt2008</span>, ch.1; <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1978">@williams1978</span>, ch.2). The progression of Descartes&#8217;s argument in the <em>Meditations</em> plausibly provides some basis for the weak vindication. Because of the demanding nature of its claim, the strong vindication stands in greater doubt. We&#8217;ll return to this in our examination of the other&nbsp;meditations.</p>
<h2 id="against-empiricism">Against&nbsp;Empiricism</h2>
<p>The lion&#8217;s share of the first <em>Meditation</em> is concerned with doubting the deliverances of sense. The structure of the argument proceeds roughly as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sensory foundations (<span class="caps">VII</span>:18)</li>
<li>Sensory fallibility (<span class="caps">VII</span>:18-19)</li>
<li>Objection: Optimal circumstances (<span class="caps">VII</span>:19)</li>
<li>Objection: Insanity (<span class="caps">VII</span>:18-19)</li>
<li>The dream argument (<span class="caps">VII</span>:19)</li>
<li>Objection: The painter’s analogy (<span class="caps">VII</span>:19-20)</li>
<li>Deceitful God; Dubitability of mathematics (<span class="caps">VII</span>:21)</li>
<li>The corrective role of doubt (<span class="caps">VII</span>:22)</li>
<li>The evil demon (<span class="caps">VII</span>:22-3)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Why argue against empiricism? There are at least two reasons motivating Descartes. The first is that empiricism is dominant in Aristotelian school philosophy. Insofar as Descartes is looking to articulate a new foundation for physics, one distinct from that traditionally offered by Scholastic Aristotelianism, he needs to argue against their&nbsp;epistemology.</p>
<p>Second, Descartes also considers empiricism to capture the natural human default attitude. He begins ¶3 of the <em>First Meditation</em> with the claim that &#8220;Whatever I have up till now accepted as most true I have acquired either from the senses or through the senses.&#8221; He says this not just because it is a scholastic doctrine but because he thinks it the natural human attitude to trust the senses above all, and if nothing else, then out of habit (¶11, <span class="caps">ATVII</span>:22). One way to thus understand the aim of the <em>Mediations</em> is as attempting to dislodge the meditating subject&#8217;s trust in the senses and the epistemic habits formed&nbsp;therefrom.</p>
