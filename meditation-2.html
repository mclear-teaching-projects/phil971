<h1 id="the-structure-of-meditation-2">The Structure of <em>Meditation</em>&nbsp;2</h1>
<p>There are two main claims made in <em>Meditation</em> 2. First, Descartes argues, in the &#8216;<em>cogito&#8217;</em>, that the one thing he cannot be deceived of is his own existence as a thinking thing. Second, Descartes argues that he has a particular nature, and that he knows this nature better than that of any&nbsp;body.</p>
<ul>
<li>The review of doubt; the <em>Cogito</em>&nbsp;(7:24-5)</li>
<li>The nature of the &#8216;I&#8217; as thinking thing&nbsp;(7:25-7)</li>
<li>The mind&#8217;s unknown relation to body&nbsp;(7:27)</li>
<li>The mind itself is not &#8216;imageable&#8217;&nbsp;(7:27-8)</li>
<li>The variety and unity of thought&nbsp;(7:28-9)</li>
<li>The &#8216;Wax Argument&#8217; &#8212;- our knowledge of body&nbsp;(7:29-33)</li>

<li>The Mind is better known than (any) body&nbsp;(7:33-4)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="an-archimedean-point">An Archimedean&nbsp;Point</h2>
<p>Descartes&#8217;s method of doubt has forced him to give up nearly all his beliefs. But he still holds out for the possibility that some belief is&nbsp;certain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakeable.&nbsp;(7:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why just one certain belief? One might reasonably wonder whether anything could be gotten from having just one certain belief. Gary Hatfield (<span class="citation" data-cites="hatfield2003">@hatfield2003</span>, 101) highlights three different answers to this question &#8212;- (1) the &#8216;foundationalist&#8217; answer: what is certain is a &#8216;first principle&#8217; from which we derive other knowledge; (2) the &#8216;systematicity&#8217; answer: what is certain is systematically connected with other knowledge (e.g. knowledge that 2 + 2 = 4 might be systematically related to knowledge that 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, etc.); (3) the &#8216;methodological&#8217; answer: what is certain reveal a method for deriving other&nbsp;certainties.</p>
<p>It is not clear which of these three answers Descartes has in mind in his statement concerning an Archimedean point. So we&#8217;ll simply have to see how he develops his&nbsp;argument.</p>
<h2 id="the-cogito">The &#8216;<em>Cogito</em>&#8217;</h2>
<p>Here is the crux of Descartes&#8217;s&nbsp;argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, <em>I am, I exist</em>, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.&nbsp;(7:25)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Descartes&#8217;s &#8216;Archimedean point&#8217; is the proposition &#8216;I am, I exist&#8217; (or its more famous form &#8220;I think, therefore I am [<em>cogito ergo sum</em>]). How should we understand this? We want to know at least the following three things&#8212;-viz., (1) what is the conclusion of the argument (i.e. what is it that is established)?; (2) how is the conclusion established?; (3) what role does the conclusion play in Descartes broader philosophical theory (i.e. can we use the <em>cogito</em> to determine which of the three answers discussed above is the right&nbsp;one)?</p>
<p>To answer (1), Descartes appears to draw two conclusions from the argument. The first is limited to the conclusion that the Meditator exists. Granting that the subject of &#8216;I&#8217; in the antecedent of the conditional is thinking, then that same subject, according to the conclusion, exists. Descartes also draws a more ambitious conclusion, viz., that the nature of the subject is that of a thinking thing or substance. In other words, the &#8216;I&#8217; of &#8216;I exist&#8217; is a particular sort of thing, a thinking thing. This more ambitious conclusion is pursued by Descartes throughout the rest of the <em>Meditation</em>.</p>
<p>Descartes seems correct to argue that from the fact that one is thinking, one can conclude that one exists. But it is not clear that this is all he needs for even his weaker conclusion. In fact, there are two serious objections to just the weak conclusion of the argument, much less the stronger&nbsp;version.</p>
<!-- TODO: I think that these two objections aren't the best way of framing the -->
<!-- issues brought up by the cogito. Maybe find some other way of presenting -->
<!-- the material? -->
<h3 id="two-objections">Two&nbsp;Objections</h3>
<p>First, we can ask what entitles Descartes (or the meditator) to the use of the first-person pronoun in the premise of his argument? Doesn&#8217;t the use of &#8216;I&#8217; in &#8216;I am thinking&#8217; <em>presuppose</em> the existence of the subject? Remember, the Meditator is here doubting his own existence. If knowledge of one&#8217;s own existence (as Meditator) is supposed to be the <em>conclusion</em> of an argument or inference we cannot assume the conclusion in the course of articulating the premises. To do so would be committing a logical fallacy&#8212;-viz., <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">begging the question</a></em> (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="dicker2013">@dicker2013</span>).</p>
<p>In response we might reformulate Descartes&#8217;s argument in a way <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum">first suggested</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Christoph_Lichtenberg">Georg Lichtenberg</a>. According to this formulation, instead of &#8216;I am thinking, therefore I exist&#8217; we should state the argument as &#8216;There is thinking (or &#8216;there is a thought&#8217;, therefore I exist&#8217;. The problem with this version of the argument, however, is that it is invalid. There is no assurance that from the mere existence of a thought it is oneself, <em>qua</em> Meditator, that exists. Without some further premise, all that may be concluded is that some thought exists, or perhaps more strongly, that some thinking thing exists, but there is no assurance that the very same think which thinks in the premise is the thing which thinks in the conclusion (cf. <span class="citation" data-cites="dicker2013">@dicker2013</span>, ch. 2; <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1978">@williams1978</span>, ch. 3; <span class="citation" data-cites="hatfield2003">@hatfield2003</span>, 103-4). All we have then is a train of thoughts.&nbsp;Compare:</p>
<p>(T1) It is thought: <em>P</em> (T2) It is thought: <em>Q</em></p>
<p>Does it follow from these that (T3) It is thought: P <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Q ? It seems that T3 cannot follow, unless we have some means for connecting T1 and&nbsp;T2.</p>
<p>In other words, there is an issue of the apparent separateness of the thoughts expressed in Descartes&#8217;s argument, to which the application of &#8216;I&#8217; presupposes an answer that Descartes cannot use without begging the question. So it seems that his supposed Archimedian point is in danger of either begging the question or being invalid. Is there a way&nbsp;out?</p>
<h4 id="the-substance-theory">The Substance&nbsp;Theory</h4>
<p>One possible strategy, which Descartes at various points seems to take, is to assume a particular metaphysics regarding our understanding of the nature of an individual object and its properties. Call this the &#8216;<em>Substance Theory</em>&#8216;. According to the Substance Theory, all things are composed of various properties as well as an underlying &#8216;substance&#8217; which has them. This is in contrast to what is typically called a &#8216;<em>Bundle Theory</em>&#8216;, according to which things are nothing more than bundles, collections, or aggregates of properties. One of the reasons to favor the Substance Theory over the Bundle Theory has to do with the issue of generation and change. Conceptually, there is a difference between a thing&#8217;s coming into being (generation) and that thing&#8217;s persisting while changing some of its properties (qualitative change). But if there really is such a distinction then there must, in addition to the properties or qualities of a thing, be some underlying thing which persists through addition or subtraction of properties (i.e. qualitative change). On the face of it the Bundle Theory cannot make this distinction, though there is <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/substance/">significant debate</a> about&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Reformulated with the assumption of a substance ontology, Descartes&#8217;s <em>Cogito</em> might be rendered as follows (<span class="citation" data-cites="dicker2013">@dicker2013</span>,&nbsp;54-5).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A thing is composed of its properties or characteristics <em>plus</em> an underlying substance to which they&nbsp;belong</li>
<li>If there is a property or characteristic, then there must be a substance to which it&nbsp;belongs.</li>
<li>A thought is a&nbsp;property.</li>
<li>If there is a thought, then there is a substance to which it&nbsp;belongs.</li>
<li>There is a&nbsp;thought.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">∴ </span> There is a substance to which this thought belongs:&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8221;.</li>
</ol>
<p>One key premise here is (2), sometimes called the &#8216;substance-property principle&#8217;, which rules out the existence of properties that do not &#8216;belong&#8217; to any substance. Descartes endorses this principle in a variety of his work (O&amp;R 7:222; Pr 8A:8, 25). The other premises are either plausibly or explicitly endorsed by him as well. What&#8217;s more, we have avoided stating the argument in a question begging way. So the question is whether the conclusion&nbsp;follows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Descartes, it is not obvious that it does. There remains the question of what allows us to call the existence of the thinking substance &#8216;I&#8217;. Notice that in the reconstructed argument above all premises are stated in the third-person until the introduction of the first-person in the conclusion. What is it that licenses this move from third-person to first-person? There is nothing in Descartes&#8217;s argument that would tell us. Hence, even the reconstruction seems to remain invalid, insofar as it attempts to prove from the (third-person) statement of the existence of thought that oneself, <em>qua</em> Meditator, exists as the thinker of that thought. So, while it is true that from that &#8216;I am thinking&#8217; one may legitimately infer &#8216;I exist&#8217;, Descartes needs something stronger&#8212;-viz., from &#8216;there is thinking&#8217; that &#8216;I exist&#8217;, and this cannot be done, it seems by the argument he&nbsp;provides.</p>
<h3 id="inference-or-intuition">Inference or&nbsp;Intuition?</h3>
<p>There is a further question concerning the nature of the apparent inference from &#8216;I am thinking&#8217; to &#8216;I exist&#8217;. Is it correct to consider this an inference, which might be put in premise-conclusion form. Or is it rather that Descartes intends us to read the claim as something grasped &#8216;intuitively&#8217; and without recourse to argument? Remember that Descartes intends the <em>Cogito</em> to be his Archimedian point, so we would like to know how the <em>Cogito</em> relates to Descartes&#8217;s foundationalism. Is the <em>Cogito</em> a bit of <em>inferential</em> knowledge, or is it&nbsp;non-inferential?</p>
<p>Descartes interestingly thinks that the answer is &#8216;both&#8217; (9A:206). First, he seems to think that our grasp of the <em>Cogito</em> is intuitive &#8212;- we come to see its conclusion &#8216;all at once&#8217;. So the Meditator does not derive it by means of any explicit argument, such as via syllogism. But, Descartes concedes, the structure of the <em>Cogito</em> is inferentially complex, so that in reflecting on what is known via the <em>Cogito</em> one is led to articulate distinct premises from which the conclusion &#8216;I exist&#8217; is ultimately supposed to follow (see <span class="citation" data-cites="hatfield2003">@hatfield2003</span>,&nbsp;112).</p>
<h3 id="the-aim-of-the-cogito">The Aim of the <em>Cogito</em></h3>
<p>Even if we grant that the <em>Cogito</em> grounds the Meditator&#8217;s certainty of his own existence, this doesn&#8217;t seem to provide Descartes with what he wants&#8212;-viz., a first principle from which the rest of his philosophical system is derived, in any of the three senses (foundational, systematic, methodological) discussed above. We&#8217;ll have to revisit this question as Descartes&#8217;s argument in the <em>Meditations</em>&nbsp;unfolds.</p>
<h2 id="the-nature-of-the-i-as-subject">The Nature of the &#8216;I&#8217; as&nbsp;Subject</h2>
<p>Recall that the <em>Cogito</em> aimed to derive two conclusions, a weak and a strong. We&#8217;ve seen that there are problems with the weak conclusion, but what of the strong? The Meditator claims to know not only that he exists, but that he is a particular kind of thing&#8212;-a thinking&nbsp;thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At present I am not admitting anything except what is necessarily true. I am, then, in the strict sense only a thing that thinks; that is, I am a mind, or intelligence, or intellect, or reason&#8212;-words whose meaning I have been ignorant of until now. But for all that I am a thing which is real and which truly exists. But what kind of a thing? As I have just said&#8212;-a thinking thing.&nbsp;[7:27]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Meditator draws this conclusion based on the fact that, as far as he knows, he has no body (remember the evil demon) nor any connection to a material world. This doesn&#8217;t yet show that the existence of his mind (or minds generally) may be had independent of any material object, but it does show (according to Descartes) that the mind is intelligible independently of any body. This might also explain why Descartes/the Meditator says that his is &#8216;ignorant&#8217; of the meanings of the words &#8216;mind, intellect, or reason&#8217; until he has gone through this method of doubt. Prior to this meditation he might have thought that the intelligibility of something&#8217;s being a mind or intellect was importantly connected to its being a&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>Descartes further understands the &#8216;I&#8217; in terms of the kinds of activity it can undertake. A thinking thing is &#8220;a thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, is willing, is unwilling, and also imagines and has sensory perceptions”&nbsp;(7:28).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Descartes&#8217;s definition of thought at the beginning of the geometrical statement of the <em>Meditations</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Thought</em>. I use this term to include everything that is within us in such a way that we are immediately aware [<em>conscii</em>] of it. Thus all the operations of the will, the intellect, the imagination and the senses are thoughts. I say &#8216;immediately&#8217; so as to exclude the consequences of thoughts; a voluntary movement, for example, originates in a thought but is not itself a thought.&nbsp;(7:160)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s Descartes&#8217;s definition of thought in the <em>Principles</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the term &#8216;thought&#8217; [cogitatio], I understand everything which we are aware of as happening within us, in so far as we have awareness [conscientia] of it. Hence, thinking is to be identified here not merely with understanding, willing and imagining, but also with sensory awareness. For if I say &#8216;I am seeing, or I am walking, therefore I exist&#8217;, and take this as applying to vision or walking as bodily activities, then the conclusion is not absolutely certain. This is because, as often happens during sleep, it is possible for me to think I am seeing or walking, though my eyes are closed and I am not moving about; such thoughts might even be possible if I had no body at all. But if I take &#8216;seeing&#8217; or &#8216;walking&#8217; to apply to the actual sense or awareness of seeing or walking, then the conclusion is quite certain, since it relates to the mind, which alone has the sensation or thought that it is seeing or walking.&nbsp;(7A:7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes thus unites a variety of different kinds of mental acts, mental capacities, and mental properties under one general rubric of &#8220;thought/thinking&#8221;. But what, exactly, unites such a disparate group? The link between these, according to Descartes, is that one and all are the kind of thing of which a subject may be &#8220;immediately&#8221; aware. They are, one and all, kinds of activity which are available to consciousness. Even sensory experience, which might formerly have been associated with having a body, is now understood in terms of availability to consciousness. We cannot yet say whether Descaertes/the Meditator intend to <em>identify</em> thinking with consciousness, or even to consider it essential. But it does provide a unifying characteristic to what is otherwise a motley&nbsp;collection.</p>
<p>For example, Descartes makes light of the issue of the &#8216;ownership&#8217; of the various activities. He&nbsp;says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it not one and the same &#8216;I&#8217; who is now doubting almost everything, who nonetheless understands some things, who affirms that this one thing is true, denies everything else, desires to know more, is unwilling to be deceived, imagines many things even involuntarily, and notices many things as apparently coming from the senses?&nbsp;(7:28-9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One reason why he might make light of the question whether there is one and the same &#8216;I&#8217; aware of all these activities is that they are all available to consciousness is roughly the same unmediated&nbsp;manner.</p>
<h2 id="wax-argument">The Wax Argument <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Knowledge of&nbsp;Body</h2>
<p>Descartes considers an objection to his argument thus far&#8212;-viz. that perhaps one may still think that material bodies are better and more clearly known than the mind. After all, the Meditator&#8217;s reflections thus far have been very abstract, and the knowledge of the mind fairly limited, specifically to the kinds of activities of which it is capable (and it isn&#8217;t even clear what binds this list of activities together or if the list is even&nbsp;complete).</p>
<p>Descartes aims to prove at least two things in this final part of the <em>Second Meditation</em>. First, he wants to show that the nature of body is known, but not via the senses. Instead it is known via the intellect. Second, he wants to show that even though the nature of body is known via the intellect, the nature of mind is known better than any material&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>So what is it that is so clearly understood about body, specifically, the piece of wax the Meditator contemplates? Descartes&#8217;s first aim is to show that the fact that we can have a sensory &#8216;image&#8217; of the wax via our various sense modalities does not tell us anything clearly about the <em>wax</em>. All it does is present us with a specific array of determinate qualities, all of which change or can change under various circumstances. However, as the Meditator notes, despite changes of quality we understand something as persisting, viz., the wax itself. So what is this persisting thing, and whence comes our cognitive grasp of it if it is not any particular sensory quality grasped via the&nbsp;senses?</p>
<p>Descartes/the Meditator argues that the wax is <em>extendible</em>, <em>flexible</em>, and <em>changeable</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But what is meant here by “flexible” and “changeable”? Is it what I picture in my imagination: that this piece of wax is capable of changing from a round shape to a square shape, or from a square shape to a triangular shape? Not at all: for I can grasp that the wax is capable of countless changes of this kind, yet I am unable to run through this immeasurable number of changes in my imagination, from which it follows that it is not the faculty of imagination that gives me my grasp of the wax as flexible and changeable.&nbsp;(7:13)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have a kind of argument from elimination. We have various sensory experiences of the sensible qualities of the wax&#8212;-e.g. its flexibility and changeability. But we know, the Meditator argues, that <em>the wax</em> is flexible and changeable. Moreover, we do not know this via any sensory &#8216;image&#8217;. Instead we seem to grasp it independently, via the intellect alone. Gary Hatfield reconstructs the argument as follows (<span class="citation" data-cites="hatfield2003">@hatfield2003</span>,&nbsp;130-1).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I can grasp that this melted wax is flexible and changeable so as to be capable of innumerable changes of&nbsp;shape.</li>
<li>Imagination could allow me to grasp this fact only by representing these changes by an image of each possible&nbsp;shape.</li>
<li>My imagination cannot represent the innumerable shapes&nbsp;required.</li>
<li>It is not the imagination that allows me to grasp this capability of the&nbsp;wax.</li>
<li>But I do grasp this capability, so it must be by a faculty other than (sense or) imagination: call it the&nbsp;&#8220;intellect&#8221;.</li>

<p>So, according to the Meditator/Descartes, the nature of the wax as extended, flexible, and changable (i.e. as a body persisting through qualitative change) is ultimately known via the <em>intellect</em> and not via the <em>senses</em> (or the&nbsp;imagination).</p>
<p>This argument also makes clear why the Meditator might reasonably claim that our cognitive grasp of body is no less intellectual than our grasp of ourselves as thinking things. What&#8217;s more, according to the Meditator, since our cognitive grasp of body is ultimately via thought, and we are acquainted with our thoughts more intimately than with any body (as the method of doubt was supposed to show), we actually know our nature as thinking beings better than any&nbsp;body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, I ask, is this &#8216;I&#8217; which seems to perceive the wax so distinctly? Surely my awareness of my own self is not merely much truer and more certain than my awareness of the wax, but also much more distinct and evident, For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see it, clearly this same fact entails much more evidently that I myself also exist. It is possible that what I see is nor really the wax; it is possible that I do not even have eyes with which to see anything. But when I see, or think I see (I am not here distinguishing the two), it is simply not possible that I who am now thinking am not something. By the same token, if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I touch it, the same result follows, namely that I exist. If I judge that it exists from the fact that I imagine it, or for any other reason, exactly the same thing follows, And the result that I have grasped in the case of the wax may be applied to everything else located outside me.&nbsp;(7:33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the pure intellect is set up, contrary to Aristotelianism, as the fundamental organ of human cognition, and as one whose nature can best be known, and via pure&nbsp;reflection.</p>
