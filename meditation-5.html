</ol>
<p>Descartes begins by asking whether &#8220;any certainty can be achieved regarding material objects&#8221; (7:63). This leads him first to make a claim about the essence of&nbsp;matter.</p>
<h1 id="the-essence-of-matter">The Essence of&nbsp;Matter</h1>
<p>The essence of matter is &#8220;continuous quantity&#8221; or&nbsp;extension</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quantity, for example, or &#8216;continuous&#8217; quantity as the philosophers commonly call it, is something I distinctly imagine. That is, I distinctly imagine the extension of the quantity (or rather of the thing which is quantified) in length, breadth and depth. I also enumerate various parts of the thing, and to these parts I assign various sizes, shapes, positions and local motions; and to the motions I assign various durations.&nbsp;(7:63)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One innovation here is that Descartes argues that we can know the essence of a thing whether or not we know that it exists. In this sense knowledge of essence is independent of knowledge of existence. This is in contrast to the Aristotelian conception according to which knowledge of essence is something &#8216;abstracted&#8217; from our experience of objects in the&nbsp;world.</p>
<h2 id="essence-as-primary-attribute">Essence as Primary&nbsp;Attribute</h2>
<p>What is it to say that the essence or primary attribute of matter is extension? In the <em>Principles</em>, Descartes explains that each substance has a “principal attribute” or “property” that “constitutes its nature and essence, and to which all its other properties are referred” (8A:25). This means that all of the properties of a thing&#8212;-including all its modes&#8212;-are to be &#8220;referred&#8221; to some primary property, without which that thing would not be what it is. In the case of body (i.e. matter), the primary attribute or &#8220;essence&#8221; is&nbsp;extension.</p>
<p>Descartes seems to be making two claims here. The first concerns the intelligible structure of a thing. In reasoning about or understanding what a thing is, Descartes claims, we must be able to make connections between the various qualities attributed to a thing. If we cannot then we will not be able to understand what the thing is and why it is that way. In the case of body, Descartes is claiming that our understanding of any body requires thinking of it as first and foremost, an extended thing. All other properties attributed to a body must therefore be understood in relation to its being extended, and ultimately just as <em>ways of its being extended</em>.</p>
<p>Descartes is thus making, aside from the above claim about intelligibility, a metaphysical claim as well&#8212;-viz. that the property of being extended is the most metaphysically fundamental property a material substance can have, and is the property upon which all of its other properties&nbsp;rely.</p>
<h2 id="essence-generalized">Essence&nbsp;Generalized</h2>
<p>After claiming to have articulated the essence of body, Descartes goes on to make a series of more general claims about how one might come to knowledge of the essence of a thing independently of any issue of its existence. We might come to have knowledge of the &#8220;true and immutable nature&#8221; (7:64) of a thing by reflection on our idea of it. The content of this idea need not have come from anything outside the subject&#8212;-it could be innate. Moreover, its content is &#8220;not invented by me [the meditator] or dependent on my mind&#8221; (7:45). The mark of this is somewhat psychological. Descartes notes that with respect to such ideas (e.g. geometric ideas) they seem not invented but rather <em>discovered</em>. They are truths which the mind recognizes whether it wants to or not (7:64). This point, that one can have knowledge of the essence of a thing just by contemplating clear and distinct idea, and that this can give one knowledge of it is then put to work with respect to the idea of God and of God&#8217;s&nbsp;essence.</p>
<h1 id="the-ontological-argument">The Ontological&nbsp;Argument</h1>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-argument">Structure of the&nbsp;Argument</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Statement of the ontological argument&nbsp;(7:65)</li>
<li>Objection 1: existence is separable from essence&nbsp;(7:66)</li>
<li>Objection 2: existence in thought is different from real existence&nbsp;(7:66)</li>
<li>Objection 3: the necessity of God&#8217;s existence is only hypothetical&nbsp;(7:67)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-argument">The&nbsp;Argument</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-%20ontological/">ontological argument</a> differs from Descartes&#8217;s previous proofs in that it purports to prove God&#8217;s existence simply from an innate and clear and distinct idea of God&#8217;s essence. So this isn&#8217;t a proof that relies on the cause of the idea, or on the finitude or preservation of the&nbsp;subject.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if the mere fact that I can produce from my thought the idea of something entails that everything which I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to that thing really does belong to it, is not this a possible basis for another argument to prove the existence of God? Certainly, the idea of God, or a supremely perfect being, is one which I find within me just as surely as the idea of any shape or number, And my understanding that it belongs to his nature that he always exists) is no less clear and distinct than is the case when I prove of any shape or number that some property belongs to its nature. Hence, even if it turned out that not everything on which I have meditated in these past days is true, I ought still to regard the existence of God as having at least the same level certainty as I have hitherto attributed to the truths of mathematics.&nbsp;(7:65)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proof differs from <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/">previous versions</a> of the ontological argument, in that it does not depend on an arbitrary definition of God but rather an innate idea whose content is clearly and distinctly perceived. Thus, just as one can come to know basic geometrical truths by reflecting on the content of geometric ideas, Descartes thinks one also comes to know that God exists, just by reflection on the content of one&#8217;s idea of&nbsp;God.</p>
<h2 id="three-objections">Three&nbsp;Objections</h2>
<h3 id="existence-and-essence">Existence and&nbsp;Essence</h3>
<p>The first objection is that we readily distinguish between the essence of a thing, what it is for that thing to be the kind of thing it is, and the existence of a thing. A ready example of this can be seen in geometry. Geometrical figures, as described by, e.g. Euclid, have essences. That is, they have definite characteristics that categorize them as the things they are (triangles have three sides and angles that sum to 180˚, quadrilateral figures have four sides and angles that sum to 360˚, etc.). However, it would be wrong to say that, for these figures, their essence is inseperable from their existence. For a particular geometric figure, we can distinguish what characteristics is must necessarily have <em>were it to exist</em> even when conceding that the figure <em>may not actually exist</em>. If we can make this distinction in the case of geometric figures, then why not with God? Descartes puts the objection this&nbsp;way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I have been accustomed to distinguish between existence and essence in everything else, I find it easy to persuade myself that existence can also be separated from the essence of God, and hence that God can be thought of as not existing&nbsp;(7:66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes then replies that careful consideration of the content of the idea of God shows us that God&#8217;s essence is inseparable from its&nbsp;existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when I concentrate more carefully, it is quite evident that existence can no more be separated from the essence of God than the fact that its three angles equal two right angles can be separated from the essence of a triangle, or than the idea of a mountain can be separated from the idea of a valley. Hence it is just as much of a contradiction to think of God (that is, a supremely perfect being) lacking existence (that is, lacking a perfection), as it is to think of a mountain without a valley&nbsp;(7:66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we get a clarification of Descartes&#8217;s view. The reason why it would be self-contradictory to think of God as lacking existence is because existence, according to Descartes, is a perfection, and God essentially (i.e. as part of God&#8217;s essence) has all perfections, so God must&nbsp;exist.</p>
<h3 id="real-or-fictitious">Real or&nbsp;Fictitious?</h3>
<p>The next objection worries about how we can be sure that the content of our ideas matches&nbsp;reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>even granted that I cannot think of God except as existing, just as I cannot think of a mountain without a valley, it certainly does not follow from the fact that I think of a mountain with a valley that there is any mountain in the world; and similarly, it does nor seem to follow from the fact that I think of God as existing that he does exist. For my thought does not impose any necessity on things; and just as I may imagine a winged horse even though no horse has wings, so I may be able to attach existence to God even though no God exists.&nbsp;(7:66)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the objection asks (i) whether it would follow simply from one&#8217;s thought that God exists that He exists, which (ii) seems fallacious given other examples of fictitious thought, such as thinking of a winged&nbsp;horse.</p>
<p>Descartes replies that this objection gets things the wrong way&nbsp;round.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a sophism concealed here [i.e. in the above argument]. From the fact that I cannot think of a mountain without a valley, it does not follow that a mountain and valley exist anywhere, but simply that a mountain and a valley, whether they exist or not, are mutually inseparable. But from the fact that I cannot think of God except as existing, it follows that existence is inseparable from God, and hence that he really exists. It is not that my thought makes it so, or imposes any necessity on any thing; on the contrary, it is the necessity of the thing itself, namely the existence of God, which determines my thinking in this respect. For I am not free to think of God without existence (that is, a supremely perfect being without a supreme perfection) as I am free to imagine a horse with or without wings.&nbsp;(7:66-7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes denies that his claim is that thinking makes it so&#8212;-the necessity of God&#8217;s features constrain our thinking concerning them. Descartes also denies that the connection could be merely fictitious. If it were then the connection would be under the thinker&#8217;s control, in the way that thinking of a horse as winged (or not) is under the thinker&#8217;s control. Hence, Descartes assumes that thought of fictitious connections is always subject to the thinker&#8217;s will, while what is intrinsically connected will be inseperable in&nbsp;thought.</p>
<h3 id="hypothetical-necessity">Hypothetical&nbsp;Necessity</h3>
<p>Descartes then goes on to pose a third&nbsp;objection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Assuming that] while it is indeed necessary for me to suppose God exists, once I have made the supposition that he has all perfections (since existence is one of the perfections), nevertheless the original supposition was not necessary. Similarly, the objection would run, it is not necessary for me to think that all quadrilaterals can be inscribed in a circle; but given this supposition, it will be necessary for me to admit that a rhombus can be inscribed in a circle &#8212; which is patently false.&nbsp;(7:67)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if we assume that God has all perfections, and that existence is such a perfection, then Descartes&#8217;s conclusion follows. But why make these assumptions? What justifies&nbsp;them?</p>
<p>Descartes&#8217;s reply again draws on the distinction between the content of a fictitious idea, whose characterisitcs may be seperated at will, and the content of the idea of God, which necessarily posits God&#8217;s possession of all perfections, including&nbsp;existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now admittedly, it is not necessary that I ever light upon any thought of God; but whenever I do choose to think of the first and supreme being, and bring forth the idea of God from the treasure house of my mind as it were, it is necessary that I attribute all perfections to him, even if I do not at that time enumerate them or attend to them individually. And this necessity plainly guarantees that, when I later realize that existence is a perfection, I am correct in inferring that the first and supreme being exists. In the same way, it is not necessary for me ever to imagine a triangle; but whenever I do wish to consider a rectilinear figure having just three angles, it is necessary that I attribute to it the properties which license the inference that its three angles equal no more than two right angles, even if I do not notice this at the time. By contrast, when I examine what figures can be inscribed in a circle, it is in no way necessary for me to think that this class includes all quadrilaterals. Indeed, I cannot even imagine this, so long as I an willing to admit only what I clearly and distinctly understand. So there is a great difference between this kind of false supposition and the true ideas which are innate in me, of which the first and most important is the idea of God.&nbsp;(7:67-8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the idea of God includes the concept <code>&lt;existence&gt;</code>, in the just the same (necessary) way that the idea of a triangle includes <code>&lt;three sided&gt;</code>. We know that &#8220;This idea isn’t a fiction, a creature of my thought, but rather an image of a true and unchanging nature&#8221; because we have a clear and distinct perception of&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2 id="cateruss-objection">Caterus&#8217;s&nbsp;Objection</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if it is granted that a supremely perfect being carries the implication of existence in virtue of its very title, it still does not follow that the existence in question is anything actual in the real world; all that follows is that the concept of existence is inseparably linked to the concept of a supreme being. So you cannot infer that the existence of God is anything actual unless you supposes that the supreme being actually exists; for then it will actually contain all perfections, including the perfection of real existence. (7:99; <span class="caps">CAM</span> p.&nbsp;136)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, do we really know that such a being exists that corresponds to our concept? Descartes takes the objection to be a version of the second objection discussed above&#8212;-viz., whether the concept of God is fictional, in the sense of being constructed out of other materials (e.g. our experience of finite beings from which we extrapolate). But Caterus seems to be objecting to the claim that the necessity to which we attach the concept <code>&lt;existence&gt;</code> to the concept <code>&lt;God&gt;</code> must track or mirror some real relation of God&#8217;s existence in reality. Caterus is thus not objecting to the claim Descartes makes concerning the connection of the two concepts <code>&lt;existence&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;God&gt;</code>. Instead he is objecting to the claim that this conceptual connection is a sufficient basis for making a claim about an extra-mental reality&#8212;-viz. that <em>God</em> (the being) and <em>existence</em> (the property) really are so&nbsp;connected.</p>
<p>Caterus&#8217;s objection is especially pressing, given that for Descartes the idea of God is innate. The question is thus how an innate idea, an idea that does not originate from the external world, could nevertheless accurately reflect reality. This worry holds as much for geometrical figures, which determine the essential properties of all material beings, as it does for&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>To that extent that Descartes has resources to defend his version of the ontological argument, the defense hinges on his fundamental claim that clear and distinct ideas, despite their being innate, provide us with an adequate representation of reality. This would seem to point to the truth rule &#8212; the idea that clear and distinct ideas are true and sufficient for knowledge. Hence, we have to consider the justification for the truth rule, if there is&nbsp;any.</p>
<h1 id="the-cartesian-circle">The Cartesian&nbsp;Circle</h1>
<p>As was suggested in the discussion of the <em>Third Meditation</em>, the need for a proof of God hinges, at least in part, on the need for a certification of clear and distinct ideas as guaranteeing truth. At the end of the <em>Fifth Meditation</em> Descartes makes clear that such a proof is necessary if we are to achieve certainty of even the simplest things, such as basic mathematical&nbsp;truths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, however, I have perceived that God exists, and at the same time I have understood that everything else depends on him, and that he is no deceiver; and I have drawn the conclusion that everything which I clearly and distinctly perceive is of necessity true. Accordingly, even if I am no longer attending to the arguments which led me to judge that this is true, as long as I remember that I clearly and distinctly perceived it, there are no counter-arguments which can be adduced to make me doubt it, but on the contrary I have true and certain knowledge of it. And I have knowledge not just of this matter, but of all matters which I remember ever having demonstrated, in geometry and so on&#8230;Thus I see plainly that the certainty and truth of all knowledge depends uniquely on my awareness of the true God, to such an extent that I was incapable of perfect knowledge about anything else until I became aware of him.&nbsp;(7:70-1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <em>Third Meditation</em> Descartes argued that his clear and distinct idea of God grounded certainty of God&#8217;s existence. God&#8217;s existence and nature were then used to ground the truth rule. Arnauld, in the <em>Fourth Objections</em> points out that this reasoning is&nbsp;circular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have one further worry, namely how [Descartes] avoids reasoning in a circle when he says that we are sure that what we clearly and distinctly perceive is true only because God exists. But we can be sure that God exists only because we distinctly and clearly perceive this. Hence, before we can be sure that God exists we ought to be able to be sure that whatever we perceive clearly and evidently is true. (7:214; <span class="caps">CSM</span> p.&nbsp;142)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes&#8217;s reply relies on the distinction between knowledge, at a time, derived from one&#8217;s clear and distinct ideas, and knowledge at some later time based on the <em>memory</em> of such a derivation (7:246; <span class="caps">CSM</span> 142-3). Descartes argues that the <em>proof</em> of God relies only the on the clear and distinct idea of God, while the subject&#8217;s capacity to <em>retain</em> knowledge (but not the reliability of clear and distinct ideas themselves), such as through memory, relies on the the proof of God&#8217;s existence, and the fact that He is no&nbsp;deceiver.</p>
<p>Is this a convincing means of getting out of the&nbsp;circle?</p>
